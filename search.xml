Do not isolate yourself in your fear or in your negative imagination. Do not isolate yourself in your fantasies. Do not think you are alone, for this is a fantasy. Today do not be alone. Realize that those who are with you are not persuaded by your errors or dismayed by your failures, but recognize your true nature and your Knowledge. Those who are with you today love you without exception. Receive their love, for this will confirm that you are not alone, and this will confirm that you do not wish to be alone. Why else would you want to be alone except to hide your pain, your sense of failure and your sense of guilt? These things which are the result of your separation only isolate you further. </p><p>今天不要独自一人。不要在你的恐惧中或负面的想象中孤立你自己。不要在你的幻想中孤立你自己。不要认为你是孤单的，因为这只是一个幻想。今天不要独自一人。意识到那些与你同在的人不会被你的错误所说服，也不会因为你的失败而气馁，而是认出你的真正自然和内识。今天与你同在的人无一例外地爱你。接纳他们的爱，因为这将确认你并不是独自一人，这将确认你不愿孤身一人。你为什么要孤身一人呢？除了隐藏你的痛苦、失败感和负罪感之外，还有什么理由呢？这些因分离而产生的事情只会让你更加孤立。</p><p>Yet today you are not alone. Therefore, choose not to be alone, and you will see that you have never been alone. Choose not to isolate yourself, and you will see that you are part of life already. Confirm this upon the hour and realize again the many opportunities to consider this throughout the day. In your deeper meditation practices, begin with the invocation of today’s message. Then enter into stillness and silence where there is no separation. Allow yourself to receive the great gifts of love which are due you and dispel any sense of inadequacy and unworthiness that are merely the residue of your separate, imagined life. Today you are not alone. Therefore, there is hope for the world.</p><p>然而，今天你并不是孤身一人。因此，选择不再孤身一人，你会发现你从未孤单过。选择不再孤立你自己，你会看到你已经是生命的一部分。每小时提醒你自己这一点，并再次意识到整天都有很多机会来考虑这一点。在你更深层次的冥想练习中，以今天的讯息作为开端。然后进入静止与静默，内识中没有分离。允许你自己收到应得的伟大之爱的礼物，驱散任何不足感和不配感，这些不过是你孤立的、想象的生命的残余。今天你并不是孤身一人，因此，世界是充满希望的。</p><p>Practice 315: Two 30-minute practice periods.

Do not be afraid to be a student, for you are a student. Do not be afraid to learn, for you are a learner. Merely accept what you are and utilize it for good. Here you end the war against yourself, where you have attempted to be something that you are not. Learn to accept yourself, and you will realize you are accepted. Learn to love yourself, and you will realize that you are loved. Learn to receive yourself, and you will learn that you are received. How can you love, accept and receive yourself? By being a student of Knowledge, because here all these accomplishments are natural. You must accomplish them to be with Knowledge, and Knowledge will accomplish them. Thus, a simple means is given to you to resolve a seemingly complex dilemma. </p><p>不要害怕跟随，因为你本就是一名跟随者。不要害怕成为学生，因为你本就是一名学生。不要害怕学习，因为你本就是一名学习者。只需接受你的内识，并将其用于正途。在这里，你结束了与你自己的战争——这场你试图成为你自己所不是之人的战争。学会接受你自己，你就会意识到你已经被接受。学会爱你自己，你就会意识到你已经被爱。学会接纳你自己，你就会意识到你已经被接纳。你如何才能爱你自己、接受你自己、接纳你自己？成为内识的学生，因为在这里，所有这些成就都是自然而然的。你必须实现这些，才能与内识同在，而内识也会成就它们。因此，一个简单的方法被赐予你，以解决一个看似复杂的困境。</p><p>Do not doubt the power of Knowledge within you and what it can accomplish, for you cannot comprehend the meaning of Knowledge, the source of Knowledge or the mechanism of Knowledge. You can only receive its beneficence. You are only asked to receive this day. You are only asked to be a recipient of Knowledge. </p><p>不要怀疑你内在内识的力量及其所能成就的事情，因为你无法理解内识的意义、内识的来源或内识的运作方式。你只能接受它的恩惠。今天，你唯一需要做的就是接受。今天，你唯一需要做的就是成为内识的接收者。</p><p>Upon the hour remember your idea and give it serious consideration throughout the day. Realize the many opportunities to practice this day, as your mind now is being drawn away from fantasy and confusion. Realize how much time and energy is available to you. You will be amazed at how your life will open and what great opportunities will begin to emerge for you.</p><p>每小时提醒你自己今天的想法，并在整天认真思考它。意识到今天有许多练习的机会，因为你的心灵正从幻想和困惑中被带离。意识到你拥有多少时间和能量。你会惊讶地发现你的生命将如何展开，以及哪些伟大的机会将开始为你浮现。</p><p>In your deeper practices today, once again enter stillness. Once again take refuge from the vicissitudes and the confusion of the world. Once again enter the sanctuary of Knowledge to give yourself. It is in this giving that you receive. It is in this giving that you will find what you seek this day.</p><p>在今天更深层次的练习时段，再次进入静止。再次从世界的起伏和混乱中寻求庇护。再次进入内识的圣殿，去给予你自己。正是在这份给予中，你才能获得。正是在这份给予中，你才能找到你今天所寻求的内识。</p><p>Practice 314: Two 30-minute practice periods.

      <title>第三百一十三阶：让我认识到，复杂的问题其实是简单的。</title>
      <link href="/2025/02/03/313/"/>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="STEP-313-LET-ME-RECOGNIZE-THAT-WHAT-IS-COMPLEX-IS-SIMPLE"><a href="#STEP-313-LET-ME-RECOGNIZE-THAT-WHAT-IS-COMPLEX-IS-SIMPLE" class="headerlink" title="STEP 313 LET ME RECOGNIZE THAT WHAT IS COMPLEX IS SIMPLE."></a>STEP 313 LET ME RECOGNIZE THAT WHAT IS COMPLEX IS SIMPLE.</h2><p>You think your personal problems are complex. You think the world’s problems are complex. You  think your future and your destiny are complex. This is because you have lived in imagination and have attempted to resolve questions without certainty. This is the result of using your personal beliefs to organize the universe according to your liking. This is the result of attempting the impossible, and this is the result of failing the impossible. </p><p>你认为你个人的问题是复杂的。你认为世界的问题是复杂的。你认为你的未来和你的天命是复杂的。这是因为你一直生活在想象之中，试图在没有确定性的情况下解决问题。这是你用个人信念按照你的喜好来组织宇宙的结果。这是尝试做不可能的事情的结果，也是未能完成不可能事情的结果。</p><p>You have been saved because Knowledge is with you. You have been redeemed because you are learning to receive Knowledge. Thus it is that all conflicts will become resolved, and you will find true purpose, meaning and direction in the world. You will find that you will still attempt to solve your problems for yourself, and this will only remind you that you need Knowledge to guide you, for all your own efforts can do without Knowledge is remind you of your need for Knowledge. </p><p>你已经被拯救，因为内识与你同在。你已经被救赎，因为你正在学习接收内识。因此，所有的冲突将会得到解决，你将在世界中找到真正的目的、意义和方向。你会发现，你仍然会试图为你自己解决问题，而这只会提醒你需要内识来指导你，因为没有内识，你的所有努力只能提醒你对内识的需求。</p><p>Therefore, today remember upon the hour that Knowledge is with you and that you are a student of Knowledge. Have confidence that all problems you perceive—great and small, within yourself and without—will be resolved through Knowledge. Remind yourself as well that this does not put you in a passive state. This will require your active engagement as a student of Knowledge and the active development of your abilities for a true purpose. Indeed, you have been passive before because of your attempts at the impossible and your failure at the impossible. Now you are becoming active, and that which is active within you is Knowledge, for you are now receiving your True Self. </p><p>因此，今天每小时提醒你自己，内识与你同在，你是内识的学生。确信你所感知到的所有问题——无论大小，内在或外在——都将通过内识得到解决。提醒你自己，这并不会让你处于被动状态。这将要求你作为内识学生的积极参与，并积极发展你为真正目的所需的能力。事实上，你曾经是被动的，因为你试图做不可能的事，并且未能成功。现在你正在变得积极，而在你内心活跃的正是内识，因为你现在正在接纳你真正的自我。</p><p>In your two longer practices, actively engage yourself with today’s idea. Attempt to penetrate its meaning. Review all ideas and beliefs that you currently possess that are related to it. Allow yourself to take inventory of your thoughts and beliefs so that you may come to recognize the work that must be accomplished within you. You are the first recipient of Knowledge, and once you have attained a certain degree of accomplishment here, Knowledge will naturally flow through you. Your activities will then be increasingly engaged in serving the world around you, and greater problems will be presented to you so that you may be saved from your own dilemma.</p><p>在你两次较长时间的练习中，让你自己积极地参与到今天的想法中来。试图深入理解它的含义。回顾你目前所拥有的与之相关的所有想法和信念。允许你自己盘点你的思想和信念，以便你能够认识到需要在你内心完成的工作。你是内识的第一位接受者，一旦你在这里取得了一定程度的成就，内识就会自然而然地流淌在你的身上。你的活动将越来越多地投入到服务你周围的世界，而更大的问题将呈现在你面前，这样你就能从你自身的困境中被拯救出来。</p><p>Practice 313: Two 30-minute practice periods.

Some of your personal problems you will need to attend to specifically, but even here you will find that their weight upon you will diminish as you enter into a greater arena of participation in life. Knowledge gives you greater things to do, but it does not overlook any detail of what you must accomplish. Therefore, small details and great details, small adjustments and great adjustments are all included. Nothing is left out. You yourself could not possibly balance your preparation in this respect, for you would not know how to establish your priorities between what is great and what is small. Your attempt to do so would merely push you deeper into confusion and frustration. </p><p>你的许多个人问题将随着你投入更伟大的召唤得到解决。你的一些个人问题你仍然需要具体处理，但即便如此，你会发现它们对你的影响会减轻，因为你正在进入一个生命的更伟大参与领域。内识会赋予你更伟大的任务，但它不会忽视你必须完成的任何细节。因此，细小的细节和宏大的细节，微小的调整和重大的调整都包含在内。没有什么被遗漏。你自己不可能平衡在这方面的准备，因为你不知道如何在伟大和微小之间建立优先级。你尝试去做只会让你陷入更深的困惑和挫败感。</p><p>Be grateful, then, that you have been spared from attempting the impossible for yourself, for what is real is given to you. What you must do is become a student and a vehicle for Knowledge. This will activate all meaningful individual development and all meaningful individual education. It will require more of you than you have required of yourself, and all that it requires will be fulfilled and will yield its true promise for you. </p><p>因此，要感激内识，因为你已经被免于为你自己做不可能的事情，因为内识已经赐予你。你必须做的是成为一名学生，成为内识的载体。这将激活所有有意义的个人发展和教育。它对你的要求将超过你对你自己的要求，而它所要求的一切都将得到现实，并为你带来它真正的承诺。</p><p>Upon the hour remind yourself of this and take heart that a greater involvement is promised which will provide you escape from your individual misery. In your deeper practice periods today, actively engage your mind to review all of your small personal problems. Review all of the things you think hold you back and all of the things you think you must resolve for yourself. As you look at each one objectively, without denial, remember and remind yourself that a greater calling is given you which will correct these things or make their correction unnecessary. Remind yourself that Knowledge will provide correction at all levels as your life becomes uniform and directed, as your Knowledge begins to emerge and as your true sense of self begins to be recognized and received.</p><p>在每小时中，你都要提醒你自己这一点，并振作精神，因为更伟大的参与已经被承诺，它将为你提供摆脱个人痛苦的出路。在今天更深层次的练习中，积极调动你的心灵来回顾你个人所有的小问题。回顾你认为阻碍你的所有事情和你认为必须为你自己解决的所有问题。当你客观地看待每一件事时，不要否认，记住并提醒你自己，已经被赐予你的一个更伟大召唤，它将纠正这些问题或使其纠正变得不再必要。提醒你自己，内识将在各个层面提供纠正，当你的生命变得统一和有方向感，当你的内识开始显现，当你真正的自我感开始被认知和接纳时，内识会为你提供纠正。</p><p>Practice 312: Two 30-minute practice periods.

You cannot prepare yourself, for  you do not know what you are preparing for, and you do not know the methods of preparation, for these must be given to you. But you do know that you must prepare, and you do know that you must follow the steps of preparation, for this is in your Knowledge already. </p><p>你来到这个世界是为了服务它，但你必须准备好为它服务。你无法为你自己做准备，因为你不知道你在为什么做准备，也不知道准备的方法，因为这些必须交给你。但是你知道你必须准备，并且你知道你必须遵循准备的步骤，因为这些已经在你的内识之中。</p><p>You have come to serve the world. If this is denied or neglected, you will fall into disarray within yourself. If your purpose is not being served and furthered, you will feel alienated from yourself, and you will fall into the darkness of your own imagination. You will condemn yourself and believe that God condemns you as well. God does not condemn you. God calls you to recognize your purpose and fulfill it.</p><p>你来到这个世界是为了服务它。如果这一点被否定或忽视，你就会陷入你自己内心的混乱之中。如果你的目的没有得到实现和推进，你就会感到与你自己的疏远，陷入你自身想象的黑暗之中。你会谴责你自己，并相信上帝也在谴责你。上帝不会谴责你。上帝呼唤你去认清你的目的，并完成它。</p><p>Let not ambition take you into the world prematurely. Remember you are a student of Knowledge. You follow Knowledge in the world because you are preparing to be a vehicle for its contribution and a recipient of its gifts. This will require restraint on your part. This will require adherence to a greater preparation. A student need only follow the guidance of the instruction. A student need only trust in the power of the instructor. Your Knowledge will confirm this and will dispel your uncertainty here, for your Knowledge is returning to its Home and to its Source. It is returning to that to which it must return. It is responding to that which it must fulfill in the world. </p><p>不要让野心过早地把你带入这个世界。记住，你是内识的学生。你在这个世界上追随内识，是因为你准备成为内识贡献的载体和内识馈赠的接受者。这将需要你保持克制。这将需要你遵循更伟大的准备。一名学生只需要遵循指导。一名学生只需要信任老师的力量。你的内识会确认这一点，并将消除你在这里的不确定性，因为你的内识正在回归它的家园，回归它的源头。它正在回到它必须回到的地方。内识正在回应它必须在这个世界上完成的使命。</p><p>Do not hate the world or resist it, for it is the place where you will fulfill your destiny. Thus, it deserves your gratitude and appreciation. Yet also remember to respect the power of its confusion and its inducements. Here you must be strong with Knowledge, and though you appreciate the world for strengthening your resolution for Knowledge, you also take note of the world’s confusion and enter into the world carefully, with discernment and adherence to Knowledge. All of these are important, and We will remind you of them as We proceed, for they are essential for you to learn Wisdom as a student. It is both your desire for Knowledge and your capacity for Knowledge that We must cultivate and that you must learn to receive.</p><p>不要憎恨这个世界，也不要抗拒它，因为世界是你实现你天命的地方。因此，它值得你的感激和欣赏。然而，也要记住尊重世界的混乱和诱惑。在这里，你必须在内识的引导下保持坚强，虽然你感激世界帮助你坚定你对内识的决心，但你也要注意世界的混乱，并谨慎地进入世界，保持辨别力，并遵循内识。所有这些都是重要的，我们将在前进的过程中不断提醒你，因为它们对你作为学生学习智慧至关重要。我们必须培养你对内识的渴望和你接收内识的能力，你也必须学会接纳它。</p><p>Practice 311: Read the lesson three times today.</p><p>练习 311 ：今天阅读这篇课文三遍。</p>]]></content>

You who are now dedicating yourself to give and are learning of the nature of your gift and your responsibility as a giver are setting the stage for your own freedom and securing your own freedom within the world. Do not be discouraged that the world does not hold your values and do not be dismayed that the world does not share your commitment, for there are many within the world and beyond the world who are undertaking the same preparation as you. There are many who have accomplished your current preparation who now serve the world with all their heart and soul. </p><p>你的自由将通过你将真正的礼物贡献给世界而得到实现、完成和永远的恢复。你现在正致力于给予，正在学习你自己礼物的自然和作为给予者的责任，你正在为你自身的自由奠定基础，并在世界中确保你自身的自由。不要因为世界不认同你的价值观而灰心，也不要因为世界不分享你的承诺而灰心，因为世界内外有许多人正在进行与你相同的准备。有许多人已经完成了你现在的准备，他们现在全心全意地为世界服务。</p><p>Thus, you are part of a great learning community. What you are learning now all of the world must learn eventually, for all must reclaim Knowledge. This is God’s Will. We are now attempting to minimize the amount of time it will take and the difficulty that will be encountered. Yet We understand that evolution must take its course within the individual and within humanity as well. Thus, Knowledge extends itself to support the true evolution of life so that life may realize itself and fulfill itself. This process continues within you and within the world. You who are claiming your studenthood in Knowledge will claim your advocacy for Knowledge. In this, you will increasingly become a force for good in the world—a force that dispels ambivalence, confusion, and conflict, a force for peace, a force for certainty and a force for true cooperation and relationship.</p><p>因此，你是一个伟大学习社区的一部分。你现在所学习的，最终全世界都会学习，因为所有人都必须重新接纳内识。这是上帝的意志。我们现在正努力减少所需的时间和将遇到的困难。然而，我们理解，进化必须在个人和人类之间继续进行。因此，内识将扩展它自身，以支持生命的真正进化，使生命能够认识它自己并实现它自己。这个过程在你和世界中持续进行。你是内识的学生，也是内识的拥护者。在这个过程中，你将日益成为世界上的一股良善力量——一股驱散矛盾、混乱和冲突的力量，一股追求和平、确定性和真正合作与关系的力量。</p><p>Remember this idea upon the hour throughout the day and in your two deeper practice periods, actively engage your mind in thinking about this. Let your mind be a useful instrument of investigation. Once again review all your ideas and beliefs that are associated with today’s idea. Once again realize how ambivalence is still robbing you of inspiration, robbing you of motivation, robbing you of courage and robbing you of relationship. Strengthen your studenthood and your advocacy for Knowledge so that you may further escape ambivalence this day and receive the certainty that is your inheritance.</p><p>在一天中的每个小时，以及在你的两次深入练习中，记住这个想法，积极地让你的心灵思考这个问题。让你的心灵成为有用的调查工具。再次回顾与今天的想法有关的所有想法和信念。再次认识到矛盾是如何剥夺你的灵感、剥夺你的动力、剥夺你的勇气和剥夺你的关系的。加强你的学生身份和你对内识的支持，这样你就能在今天进一步摆脱矛盾，获得作为你传承的确定性。</p><p>Practice 310: Two 30-minute practice periods.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="STEP-309-THE-WORLD-I-SEE-IS-ATTEMPTING-TO-BECOME-ONE-COMMUNITY"><a href="#STEP-309-THE-WORLD-I-SEE-IS-ATTEMPTING-TO-BECOME-ONE-COMMUNITY" class="headerlink" title="STEP 309 THE WORLD I SEE IS ATTEMPTING TO BECOME ONE COMMUNITY."></a>STEP 309 THE WORLD I SEE IS ATTEMPTING TO BECOME ONE COMMUNITY.</h2><p>The world you see is attempting to become one community, for this is its evolution. How can the world evolve when it is fragmented? How can humanity advance when it is opposing itself? How can the world be at peace when one faction competes with another? The world you see is like the mind that you experience within yourself—warring with itself, yet without purpose or meaning. The world you see is attempting to become one community, for all worlds where intelligent life has evolved must become one community. </p><p>你所看到的世界正在努力成为一个社区，因为这是它的进化。一个世界如何在碎片化的状态下进化？一个人类如何在自相矛盾的状态下前进？一个世界如何能在一个派系与另一个派系竞争时获得和平？你所看到的世界就像你在你自己内心中体验的心灵——相互斗争，却没有目的或意义。你所看到的世界正在努力成为一个社区，因为所有智能生命进化的世界都必须成为一个社区。</p><p>How this will be achieved and when it will be achieved is beyond your present scope, but as you look upon the world without judgment you will see the yearning in each person to join. You will see the desire for separation to be ended. The world’s pressing problems merely exemplify its predicament and call for the creation of one community in the world. This is so obvious if you but look. As you yourself are becoming one person and healing all wounds within yourself as a student of Knowledge, so is the world attempting to become one world and to heal all of its wounds and all of its internal conflicts and separation. Why is this? Because Knowledge is in the world. </p><p>这将如何实现以及何时实现，超出了你当前的理解范围，但当你不带评判地看待这个世界时，你会看到每个人都渴望联合。你会看到他们结束分离的渴望。世界的紧迫问题只是其困境的表现，并呼唤创造一个全球社区。如果你仔细观察，这一点是显而易见的。就像你自己正在成为一个完整的人，并作为内识的学生治愈内心的创伤一样，世界也正在努力成为一个整体，治愈其创伤、内部冲突和分离。为什么会这样？因为内识就在这个世界中。</p><p>As you are discovering Knowledge within yourself, remember that Knowledge is latent within each person, and even in its latency it is casting its influence and extending its direction. The world contains Knowledge, too. It is a larger representation of yourself that you look upon. Thus, as you become a student of Knowledge and are able to objectively recognize your preparation, you will begin to have a true view of the evolution of the world. Here your viewpoint will not be distorted by personal preferences or fears, for the evolution of the world will simply be obvious to you. The evolution of the world is obvious to your Teachers, who look upon the world from beyond its constraints. But you who are within the world, who feel the influence of the world and who share the world’s doubt and uncertainty, must learn to look upon the world without these restraints as well. </p><p>当你在你自己内心发现内识时，请记住，内识在每个人内心深处都有存在，即使在内识潜伏的时候，它也在发挥影响并指引方向。世界同样包含着内识。世界是你所看见的它自己更大的体现。因此，当你成为内识的学生并能够客观看待你的准备时，你将开始真正理解世界的进化。在这里，你的观点将不被个人偏好或恐惧扭曲，因为世界的进化对你来说将是显而易见的。世界的进化对你的老师们来说也是显而易见的，他们从超越世界约束的角度看待世界。但你作为世界的一部分，感受到世界的影响并分享着世界的疑虑和不确定性，必须学会以没有这些限制的眼光来看待世界。</p><p>The world is attempting to become one community. Remind yourself of this upon the hour, and in your two deeper practice periods engage your mind actively in attempting to understand today’s idea. Think of the problems of the world and the solutions that they call for. Think of the conflicts in the world and the requirement that they be settled. Realize that if any individual or group of individuals opposes these resolutions and requirements, this will induce them to wage war against the world and one another. The conflicts you perceive are merely the attempt to preserve separation. But the world is attempting to become one community and regardless of the resistance to this, it will relentlessly attempt to do this, for this is its evolution. This is the true desire of all who dwell here, for all separation must be ended and all contribution must be given. This is your purpose and the purpose of all who have come here. </p><p>世界正在努力成为一个社区。在每小时中提醒你自己这一点，在你两次更深层次的冥想中，积极地让你的心灵努力理解今天的主题。思考世界的种种问题及其所呼唤的解决方案。思考世界的冲突以及它们需要解决的要求。意识到如果任何个人或群体反对这些解决方案和要求，他们就会对世界和彼此发动战争。你所看到的冲突只是为了维持分离的努力。但是，世界正在努力成为一个社区，尽管面临反对，它仍将不懈地尝试去实现这一点，因为这是它的进化。这是所有在此居住者的真正渴望，因为所有分离必须结束，所有的贡献必须给予。这是你的目的，也是所有来到这里的人的目的。</p><p>Remember, you have been called and you are responding to your one true purpose. In time, others will be called and they will respond. This is inevitable. You are accomplishing the inevitable, which will take a great deal of time and many steps. Knowledge is your source and Knowledge is the result. Therefore, you can be certain of the final outcome of your actions. Regardless of how the world will proceed in its preparation and its difficulties, it must accomplish this one true goal. Thus, you can proceed with certainty.</p><p>记住，你已经被召唤，你正在回应你唯一的真正目的。随着时间的推移，其他人也会被召唤，他们也会做出回应。这是不可避免的。你正在实现不可避免的事情，它将需要许多时间和许多步骤。内识是你的源泉，内识是结果。因此，你可以确信你的行动最终会产生结果。无论世界如何推进其准备和困难，它最终必须实现这个真正的目标。因此，你可以带着确定性继续前进。</p><p>In your longer meditations attempt to penetrate today’s idea. Do not be complacent here, but actively engage your mind as your mind was meant to be engaged. Try to recognize your own ambivalence about the world becoming one community. Try to recognize your fears and concerns about this. Try to recognize as well your desire for one community and your understanding that this is necessary. Once you take inventory of your own thoughts and feelings concerning today’s idea, you will further understand why the world is in its current predicament. The world has a certain destiny and a certain course to follow, yet it is ambivalent about everything. Thus, the world itself must unlearn ambivalence, as you are now learning to do, and your accomplishments will assist it in its great undertaking, for this is your contribution to the world.</p><p>在较长时间的冥想中，尝试渗透今天的想法。在这里，不要满足于表面，而要积极调动你的心灵，因为你的心灵本应被调动。试着认识到你自身对世界成为一个社区的矛盾心理。试着认识到你对此的恐惧和担忧。同时也要认识到你对一个社区世界的渴望，并理解这是必要的。一旦你清点了你自身对今天这个想法的思想和感受，你就会进一步理解为什么世界会陷入目前的困境。世界已经有一个特定的天命和轨迹，但它却对一切都充满矛盾。因此，世界本身必须摆脱矛盾，就像你现在正在学习摆脱矛盾一样，而你的成就将帮助它完成这个伟大的事业，因为这是你对世界的贡献。</p><p>Practice 309: Two 30-minute practice periods.

      <title>第三百零八阶：回顾</title>
      <link href="/2025/01/27/308/"/>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="STEP-308-REVIEW"><a href="#STEP-308-REVIEW" class="headerlink" title="STEP 308 REVIEW"></a>STEP 308 REVIEW</h2><p>In your longer practice period today undertake the Review of the past two weeks of training according to Our previous instructions. This is a very important review period, for you will be reviewing the invocations that have been given to you, and you will be reviewing as well the potency of the task that you are undertaking as a student of Knowledge. Recognize in these past two weeks your own fear of Knowledge. Realize your own fear of the mystery of your life. Recognize any attempts that you might have made to re-enter illusion and imagination. Recognize this contrast in learning which is so essential to your understanding. </p><p>在今天的长时间练习中，按照我们之前的指示进行过去两周练习的回顾。这是一个非常重要的回顾阶段，因为你将回顾之前给你的祈祷，并且回顾你作为内识学生所承担的任务的力量。在这两周的时间里，意识到你自己对内识的恐惧。意识到你对你自身生命的神秘感到的恐惧。识别你可能试图重新进入幻象和幻想的任何努力。认识到这种学习中的对比对你理解的至关重要。</p><p>Review this with objectivity and compassion. Know that your ambivalence towards life must be realized and that it will continue to express itself with ever decreasing potency as you come closer and closer to Knowledge. Remember that Knowledge is life itself, the very essence of life. It is changeless and yet expressing itself through change constantly. To experience it, you must strengthen your participation as a student of Knowledge and remember that you are a beginning student of Knowledge so that you cannot rely upon your assumptions. You must receive the curriculum and be guided in applying it. In this way, you will be safe from all misapplication, all misinterpretation and thus safe from error. </p><p>带着客观和同情心进行回顾。要知道，你对生命的矛盾必须被认识，并且它将在你越来越接近内识时，逐渐表达出越来越少的力量。记住，内识就是生命本身，生命的精髓。它是不变的，但却在不断地通过变化进行表达。要体验它，你必须加强你作为内识学生的参与，并记住你是一个刚开始的内识学生，因此不能依赖你的假设。你必须接受课程并在应用时得到指导。通过这种方式，你将远离所有的错误应用、误解，从而远离错误。</p><p>This Review is very important, for you are now reaching a great turning point in your participation as a student of Knowledge. Knowledge is beginning to have potency now. You are beginning to feel its power. You are beginning to realize its total importance to you. You who have been partial with life in the past are now realizing that life is completely with you and will require that you be completely with it. This is your salvation and your redemption, for here all separation, fear and misery are dispelled. What can you possibly lose to receive such a gift? You lose only your imagination, which has haunted you, threatened you and frightened you. Yet even your imagination will be given a greater purpose with Knowledge, for it is meant to serve you in a different way.</p><p>这个回顾是非常重要的，因为你现在正处于作为内识学生参与的一个伟大转折点。内识开始拥有它的力量。你开始感受到它的力量。你开始意识到它对你来说的重要性。你过去与生命的关系是部分而残缺的，而现在你开始意识到生命是完全与你同在的，并且生命要求你完全与它同在。这是你的拯救和救赎，因为在这里所有的分离、恐惧和痛苦都被驱散了。你能失去什么来接受这样的礼物呢？你只会失去你过去曾困扰你、威胁你并让你感到恐惧的幻想。然而，即使是你的幻想，也会在内识中找到更伟大的目的，因为它旨在以不同的方式为你服务。</p><p>Carry on your Review with great depth and sincerity. Do not be concerned how long this takes. Your time cannot be better spent. Review the past two weeks so that you may observe the advancement of Knowledge within yourself. You will need this understanding if you are to support others in the future in reclaiming Knowledge for themselves.</p><p>以伟大的深度和诚意进行你的回顾。不要担心这需要多长时间，你的时间不会有比这更好的使用方式。回顾过去两周的内容，以便你能够观察到内识在你内心的进展。如果你将来要支持他人重新找回他们的内识，你就需要这种理解。</p><p>Practice 308: One long practice period.</p><p>练习 308 ：一个漫长的练习期</p>]]></content>

Thus, all darkness and illusion are dispelled from your mind as you come to realize what your life has always been and will always be. As you realize the changelessness of your true existence, you will realize how it wishes to express itself in the world of change. Your Knowledge is greater than your mind, greater than your body and greater than your definitions of yourself. It is changeless yet ever changing in its expression. Beyond fear, doubt and destruction it abides within you, and as you learn to abide with it, all of its qualities will become your own. </p><p>内识就生活在你的内心深处，而你正在学习与内识共同生活。因此，当你开始意识到你生命的真实自然时，所有的黑暗和幻象都会从你的心灵中被驱散。你会意识到你真实存在的永恒不变，并明白它如何希望在这个充满变化的世界中表达它自己。你的内识比你的心灵、比你的身体、比你对你自己的定义更伟大。它是永恒不变的，但在表达上却是不断变化的。它超越了恐惧、怀疑和毁灭，常驻于你的内心，并且随着你学会与它同在，它的所有特质将成为你自身的特质。</p><p>There is nothing that the world can provide that can in any way compare to this, for all the world’s gifts are momentary and transitory. As you honor them, your fear of losing them will increase. As you hold them to yourself, your anxiety about death and destruction will be enhanced, and you will re-enter confusion and frustration. But with Knowledge, you may possess things in the world without identifying with them. You may receive them and release them according to the necessity of doing so. Then the great anxiety of the world will not affect you, but the power of Knowledge that you carry will affect the world. In this way, you will affect the world more than it affects you. In this way, you will be a contributor to the world. In this way, the world will be blessed.</p><p>世界上没有任何事物能与内识相比，因为世界上所有的礼物都是瞬间的、短暂的。当你尊重它们时，你对失去它们的恐惧也会加剧。你将它们紧紧抓住时，你对死亡和毁灭的焦虑就会增加，你会重新陷入困惑和沮丧。但有了内识，你可以拥有世界中的事物，而不与它们认同。你可以接纳它们，并根据需求将它们释放。这样，世界的巨大焦虑将不会影响你，但你所携带的内识的力量将影响世界。通过这种方式，你将更多地影响世界，而不是被世界所影响。这样，你将成为世界的贡献者。这样，世界就会得到祝福。</p><p>Rejuvenate yourself in Knowledge in your deeper practice periods in stillness and remind yourself upon the hour of the power of Knowledge that you carry this day. Let not any doubt or uncertainty dissuade you, for here doubt and uncertainty are completely unnatural. You are learning to become natural because what could be more natural than being yourself? And what could be more yourself than Knowledge itself?</p><p>在你的深度冥想练习中，在静止中让内识重新焕发活力，并在每小时的练习中提醒你自己你今天所携带的内识的力量。不要让任何怀疑或不确定性动摇你，因为怀疑和不确定性在这里是完全不自然的。你正在学习变得自然，因为还有什么比做真实的你自己更自然呢？而做最真实的你自己，难道不就是内识本身吗？</p><p>Practice 307: Two 30-minute practice periods.

Therefore, as you become more conscientious, you must select what you will learn. Here you are given a real choice, for you are either a student of Knowledge or you are a student of confusion. Do not be a student of confusion today. Do not be a student of fear today, for without Knowledge there is uncertainty and there is fear. Without Knowledge, there are fearful pursuits, which perpetrate greater fear and a greater sense of loss. </p><p>请记住，你始终是一名学生——每天、每小时、每一刻。因此，随着你变得更加自觉，你必须选择你要学习的内容。在这里，你拥有真正的选择权，因为你要么是内识的学生，要么是混乱的学生。今天不要成为混乱的学生。今天不要成为恐惧的学生，因为没有内识，就会有不确定和恐惧。没有内识，就会有充满恐惧的追求，这些追求只会制造更大的恐惧和更深的失落感。</p><p>Realize your responsibility as a student. Realize this and accept this with relief, for you have a meaningful choice here—to be a student of Knowledge or a student of confusion. Knowledge will cast its influence upon you to enable you to make the right choice, to choose that which renders you certainty, purpose, meaning and value in the world. Then you may become a force for Knowledge in the world to dispel confusion, darkness and fear from all minds that labor under their oppressive weight. </p><p>意识到你作为学生的责任。意识到这一点，并欣然接受这一点，因为你在这里可以做出有意义的选择——成为内识的学生，还是混乱的学生。内识会对你施加影响，使你能够做出正确的选择，选择那些能让你在世界上获得确定性、目的、意义和价值的事情。然后，你就可以成为世界上内识的力量，驱散所有因其沉重压迫而困扰心灵的困惑、黑暗和恐惧。</p><p>Do not be a student of fear. Make this resolution within yourself upon the hour as you recognize the fearful persuasions of the world, the confusion of the world and its dark influence upon all who feel its oppression. Allow yourself to be a liberated soul within the world. Hold the jewel of love within your heart. Hold the light of Knowledge within your heart. When you return to your two deeper meditation practices today, repeat the idea for today so that you may enter into stillness and silence within your sanctuary. Rejuvenate yourself in Knowledge and refresh yourself, for Knowledge is the great light that you carry. The more that you come within its presence, the more it will radiate itself upon you and the more it will shine upon you and, through you, upon the world.</p><p>不要成为恐惧的学生。每小时做出这样的决心，认识到世界上那些充满恐惧的诱惑、混乱和对所有人压抑的黑暗影响。允许你自己成为世界上一个解放的灵魂。在你的心中珍藏爱的宝石，珍藏内识的光明。当你进行今天两次更深层次的冥想练习时，重复今天的想法，以便你进入静止与静默的庇护所。在内识中恢复你自己，在其中焕然一新，因为内识是你所携带的伟大光芒。你越多地进入它的存在之中，它就会越多地照耀你，并通过你照耀世界。</p><p>Practice 304: Two 30-minute practice periods. Hourly practice. </p><p>练习 304 ：两次 30 分钟的练习时段，每小时练习。</p>]]></content>

      <title>第三百零三阶：今天，我会远离世界的影响力。</title>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="STEP-303-I-WILL-STEP-BACK-FROM-THE-WORLD’S-PERSUASIONS-TODAY"><a href="#STEP-303-I-WILL-STEP-BACK-FROM-THE-WORLD’S-PERSUASIONS-TODAY" class="headerlink" title="STEP 303 I WILL STEP BACK FROM THE WORLD’S PERSUASIONS TODAY."></a>STEP 303 I WILL STEP BACK FROM THE WORLD’S PERSUASIONS TODAY.</h2><p>Step back from the world’s persuasions. Recognize what is certain and what is confused. Recognize what is devoted and what is ambivalent. Let not the power of the world’s frustration and confusion overtake you today, but hold the light of God within your heart. Keep it burning within yourself as you venture into the world. Thus, you pass through the world unscathed and uninfluenced because you are abiding with Knowledge. Without Knowledge, the world merely sweeps you away in its own frenzy. It sweeps you away in its inducements and its mad pursuits. </p><p>远离世界的影响力。分辨什么是确定的，什么是混乱的；什么是忠诚的，什么是矛盾的。不要让世界的挫败感与混乱感占据你，而是将上帝的光明留在你的心中。在你探索世界时，让这光明在你自己内心燃烧。因此，你可以毫发无损且不受影响地穿越这个世界，因为你与内识同在。如果没有内识，世界只会将你卷入它的疯狂之中，将你卷入它的诱惑和狂热的追逐中。</p><p>Today you abide with Knowledge, and so you are free of the world’s persuasions. Repeat today’s idea upon the hour and recognize how important it is in maintaining your inner balance and your sense of self and certainty. Realize how important today’s idea is in allowing you to keep stillness alive within you so that your deeper meditations, in which you will practice stillness again today, can exert their influence and their results upon all of your activities, for this is their purpose. </p><p>今天你与内识同在，因此你不受世界的影响。每小时重复今天的想法，并认识到它在保持你的内在平衡以及你的自我和确定感方面的重要性。意识到今天的想法如何帮助你在内心保持静止，使你更深层次的冥想——你今天将在其中再次练习静止——能够对你的所有活动产生影响和结果，因为这正是它们的目的。</p><p>Recognize the world’s persuasions and step back. This you are given to do, for here you have the power of decision. This you can do once you recognize the world’s persuasions and realize how important Knowledge is. This will enable you to exercise the power of decision on your own behalf. Here the world will not claim you, and here you will be a force for good in the world, for this is your purpose.</p><p>认识世界的影响力并远离它。这是赋予你的能力，因为在这里你拥有决策的力量。一旦你认识到世界的影响力并理解内识的重要性，你就能够为你自身行使决策的力量。在这里，世界将无法占据你；在这里，你将成为世界中的一股善的力量，因为这是你的目的。</p><p>In your deeper meditation practices, once again give today’s idea as an invocation to prepare you. In stillness and in silence enter into the sanctuary of Knowledge so that you may rejuvenate and refresh yourself there. Find reprieve there from your own internal conflicts and from the conflicts that rage in the world. When you return from your sanctuary, remind yourself that you will not be claimed by the world’s confusion. Remind yourself that you will not fall prey to the world’s persuasions. Then you will carry forth the safety that you are now learning to receive into the world around you.</p><p>在你更深层次的冥想练习中，再次以今天的想法作为进入状态的祷文。在静止中进入内识的庇护所，让你自己在其中恢复与焕然一新。在这里，你可以从你自己内心的冲突和世界上肆虐的冲突中解脱出来。当你从圣所返回时，提醒你自己不要被世界的混乱所占据，提醒你自己不要被世界的影响力所操控。这样，你将把你现在学习到的安全感带入周围的世界。</p><p>Practice 303: Two 30-minute practice periods.

It is the place where Knowledge will express itself as you learn to become a vehicle for Knowledge. Allow the world to be as it is, for without your condemnation it will be far easier for you to be in the world, to utilize its resources and to recognize its opportunities. </p><p>不要抗拒这个世界，因为世界是你前来服务的地方。在这里，内识将通过你得以表达，因为你正在学习成为内识的载体。允许世界如其所是，因为没有你的谴责，你会更容易融入这个世界，善用它的资源并识别它的机会。</p><p>Do not resist the world, for you are from beyond the world. The world is no longer a prison for you but the place for you to contribute. To whatever extent you have not been able to adjust to the world in the past and to whatever extent being in the world has been difficult for you, you are now looking at the world in a new way. You have sought the world to replace Knowledge, and now you are realizing Knowledge is being given to you from your Source. Thus, the world is no longer being used as a substitute for Knowledge and the world can now become a canvas upon which you can express the potency of Knowledge. Thus, the world becomes what it rightfully is in your life. For this reason you do not need to resist the world today.</p><p>不要抗拒这个世界，因为你来自世界之外。世界不再是你的囚笼，而是你贡献的地方。无论你过去在多大程度上未能适应世界，或者在多大程度上感受到身处世界的困难重重，现在你正以一种新的方式看待世界。你曾经试图用世界取代内识，而现在你认识到内识是从你的源头赐予你的。因此，世界不再被当作内识的替代品，而是成为你表达内识力量的画布。因此，世界在你的生命中回归到它应有的位置。因此，今天你不需要抗拒这个世界。</p><p>As you pass through the world this day, remember this idea upon the hour and let yourself be present to whatever circumstance you are in. Allow your inner life to be still so that Knowledge may exert its influence and its guidance for you. Allow yourself to carry certainty today—the certainty of Knowledge. This is a certainty that you have not invented or constructed for yourself. It abides with you always, in spite of your confusion. </p><p>当你今天穿行于世时，每小时记住这个想法，让你自己对当下所处的环境保持在场感。让你的内心保持宁静，以便内识能对你施加影响和指引。允许你自己今天承载确定性——来自内识的确定性。这种确定性不是你自己发明或构建的，而是始终伴随你的，无论你是否感到困惑。</p><p>Do not resist the world today, for Knowledge is with you. In your longer practice periods, remember this idea both before and after your meditations. In your meditations escape the world into the sanctuary of stillness. The greater your involvement in the sanctuary of stillness, the greater ease you will have in being in the world, for you will not be attempting to use the world as a substitute for your Ancient Home. Here the world becomes beneficial to you, and you become beneficial to the world.</p><p>今天不要抗拒这个世界，因为内识与你同在。在较长的练习中，在冥想前后记住这个想法。在你的冥想中，远离尘世，进入静止的圣地。你对静止圣地的投入越多，你在世界中就会越轻松，因为你不再试图用世界取代你的古老家园。在这里，世界变得对你有益，而你也变得对世界有益。</p><p>Practice 302: Two 30-minute practice periods.

Be at peace this day. Allow stillness to abide with you as you walk through the world.</p><p>在这一天，不要让你自己迷失在焦虑的习惯中来占据你的心灵。接受你正在步入一个更伟大的生命，带着更伟大的目的感。允许你自己依赖内在内识的确定性及其对你真正关系的确认。今天要保持和平，让静止伴随着你，穿行于世间。</p><p>Upon the hour repeat today’s idea. In your deeper practices, use it as an invocation to begin and as a benediction to complete your meditation. In your meditations allow yourself to be still. Do not let uncertainty capture you today. Do not let anxiety take you away. You are abiding with Knowledge, which is the source of all certainty in the world. You are abiding with it, and you are allowing it to spread its potency and its gifts to you who are learning now to reclaim certainty for yourself. Allow this day to be a confirmation of your studenthood. Allow this day to be an expression of Knowledge.</p><p>每小时重复一次今天的想法。在更深层次的练习中，将其作为开始冥想的祈请语和结束冥想的祝福语。在冥想中，让你自己静下来。今天，不要让不确定性抓住你。不要让焦虑带走你。你与内识同在，内识是世界上一切确定性的源泉。你与它同在，让它向你传播它的力量和它的礼物，你现在正在学习为你自己找回确定性。让今天成为你学生身份的确认。让今天成为内识的表达日。</p><p>Practice 301: Two 30-minute practice periods.

Allow their reality to clarify your own, to dispel all the darkness of isolation and all of the weakness of individuality so that your individuality may find the strength of its true contribution. Do not dwell alone in your thoughts today, but enter into the presence of your Spiritual Family, for you are born of community and into community you now enter, for life is community—community without exclusion and without opposite.</p><p>接纳那些作为你精神家庭的存在，他们指导和帮助你，他们为内识所做的努力补充了你自身的努力，他们在你生命中的存在证实了真正的社区是为内识服务的。让他们的现实澄清你自身的现实，驱散所有孤立的黑暗和个体化的软弱，使你的个体性能够找到其真正贡献的力量。今天，不要孤独地沉溺在你的思想中，而是进入你的精神家庭，因为你诞生于社区，现在你进入社区，因为生命本身就是社区——没有排斥、没有对立的社区。</p><p>Remember this upon the hour today. In your longer practice periods, engage your mind actively in attempting to understand the message that you are given today. Try to understand what Spiritual Family really means. Try to understand that it is intrinsic to you. You did not choose it. You are simply born of it. It represents your accomplishment in Knowledge thus far. All accomplishment in Knowledge is the reclamation of relationships, and your Spiritual Family are those relationships that you have reclaimed thus far in your return to God. </p><p>今天每小时记住这一点。在较长的练习期间，积极调动你的心灵，试图理解今天传递给你的讯息。尝试理解精神家庭的真正含义，尝试理解它是你固有的一部分。你没有选择它，你只是生于其中。它代表了你在内识中至今所取得的成就。所有在内识中的成就都是关系的回归，而你的精神家庭是那些在你回归上帝的过程中已被你找回的关系。</p><p>This will be beyond your comprehension, but your Knowledge will resonate with the message for today and the invocations that you have practiced in previous days. Knowledge will reveal what you must know and what you must do. You are not meant to be burdened with attempting to understand that which is beyond your comprehension. But you are given the responsibility to respond to the communication that is being given to you from the mystery of your own life and from the power of God in your life.</p><p>这将超出你的理解范围，但你的内识会与今天的讯息以及你前几天练习的祈祷产生共鸣。内识会揭示你必须知道的和你必须做的。你不必试图理解那些你无法理解的事情而背上沉重的负担。但是，你有责任回应从你自身生命的神秘和上帝的力量中传递给你的讯息。</p><p>You are part of a Spiritual Family. You receive this through your experience, an experience which will confirm your participation in life and the great purpose you have come to serve.</p><p>你是精神家庭的一部分。你会通过体验来接纳这一点，而这种体验将确认你在生命中的参与以及你要服务的伟大目的。</p><p>Practice 300: Two 30-minute practice periods.

Today’s invocation engages your mind with all minds which are engaged in the reclamation of Knowledge in the universe, for you are a citizen of a Greater Community as well as a citizen of your world. You are part of a great undertaking existing both within the world and beyond, for God is at work everywhere. The True Religion, then, is the reclamation of Knowledge. It finds its expression in each world and in each culture, and there it acquires its symbolism and its rituals, but its essence is universal.</p><p>今天的祈祷召唤那些在大社区中与你一同实践内识的人们，让他们的事业和伟大成就的力量点缀你作为内识学生的所有尝试和实践。今天的祈祷将你的心灵与所有在宇宙中致力于内识回归的心灵连接起来，因为你既是这个世界的公民，也是大社区的公民。你是一项伟大事业的一部分，这项事业既存在于世界之内，也存在于世界之外，因为上帝的工作无处不在。因此，真正的宗教就是内识的回归。内识在每个世界和每种文化中找到了它的表达形式，并在其中获得其象征和仪式，但它的本质是普世的。</p><p>Practice upon the hour repeating today’s invocation and as you do so, take a moment to feel its impact. You can find a way to do this in all of your circumstances today, and this will remind you of your Ancient Home and the potency of Knowledge that you carry within you. In your deeper practice periods, repeat your invocation and then enter into the sanctuary of Knowledge in stillness and in humility. When your practice period is complete, once again repeat today’s invocation. Allow your mind to engage itself with that which is beyond the limited scope of human involvement, for Knowledge speaks of a greater life within the world and beyond. It is this greater life which you must now entertain. It is this greater life which you must now receive, for you are a student of Knowledge. Knowledge is greater than the world, but Knowledge has come to the world to serve.</p><p>每隔一小时练习一次，重复今天的祷文，在练习的过程中，花点时间感受它的影响。你可以在今天的所有情况下找到一种方式来做到这一点，这将提醒你关于你的古老家园以及你内在携带的内识的力量。在你更深入的练习期间，重复今天的祈祷，然后以静止和谦逊进入内识的圣所。当练习结束时，再次重复今天的祈祷。让你的心灵投入到人类有限的参与范围之外，因为内识谈及的是世界之内和超越世界的更伟大的生命。现在你必须接触这个更伟大的生命。现在你必须接受这个更伟大的生命，因为你是内识的学生。内识超越了这个世界，但内识来到这个世界是为了服务。</p><p>Practice 298: Two 30-minute practice periods.

Their meaning may be translated thus: “The presence of the Teachers of God is with me.” This is a simple translation of these words, but their power far exceeds their obvious meaning. They can evoke within you a deep response, for they are an invocation for Knowledge, born of an ancient language that has not originated in any world. This language represents the language of Knowledge and serves all those who speak a language and who still need a language to communicate. </p><p>今天的古老词语将激发内识。它们的含义可以这样翻译：“上帝的老师与我同在。”这是这些词语的简单翻译，但它们的力量远远超越其表面的含义。它们能唤起你内心深处的回应，因为它们是对内识的祈祷，源自一种未曾起源于任何世界的古老语言。这种语言代表着内识的语言，服务于所有使用一种语言和仍然需要一种语言进行沟通的存在。</p><p>Remembering yesterday’s lesson, do not attempt to understand the origin of these words or the mechanism for their service, but be the recipient of their gift. Upon the hour recite today’s invocation, and in your two deeper practice periods repeat the invocation and then enter into stillness and silence to feel the power of these words. Allow them to assist you in entering the depth of your own Knowledge. When each long practice period is complete and when you return to the world of action and of form, recite the invocation once again and be grateful that the mystery of your life is being penetrated. Be grateful that your Ancient Home has come with you into the world.</p><p>回忆昨天的课程，不要试图理解这些词语的来源或它们服务的机制，而是成为它们馈赠的接受者。每小时诵念今天的祈祷，在两个深入的练习期间重复诵念这段祈祷，然后进入静止与静寂去感受这些词语的力量。让它们帮助你进入你自身内识的深处。当每个长时间的练习结束时，当你回到行动与形式的世界，再次诵念这段祈祷，并心怀感恩，因为你生命的神秘正在被揭示。感恩你的古老家园随你来到这个世界。</p><p>Practice 296: Two 30-minute practice periods. Hourly practice. </p><p>练习 296 ：两次 30 分钟的练习时段，每小时练习。</p>]]></content>

The mystery of  your life is the source of all that is manifest in your life. All that will be manifest and is intended to be manifest is embodied in the mystery of your life. Therefore, your current engagement as a student of Knowledge is absolutely fundamental to everything you will do in the world and to everything you will realize and fulfill in this life. It is absolutely fundamental to your need. </p><p>你正在深入你生命的神秘，这个神秘寻求向你揭示它自身。你生命的神秘是你生命中一切显现的源泉。所有将要显现并注定要显现的一切，都蕴含在你生命的神秘之中。因此，作为一名内识的学生，你当前的参与对于你将在这个世界上所做的一切，以及你将在此生中实现和完成的一切，都是至关重要的。它对你的需求绝对是最根本的。</p><p>Allow the mystery to be mysterious. Allow the manifest to be manifest. In this way, you will enter the mystery of Knowledge with reverence and openness, and you will engage yourself in the world with a practical emphasis and a concrete approach. This will enable you to be a bridge from your Ancient Home to this temporary world. Then you will treat life in the universe with reverence and awe, and you will treat your selfapplication in the world with conciseness and responsibility. Here all your faculties will be properly cultivated and integrated, and you will be a vehicle for Knowledge. </p><p>允许神秘保持神秘。允许显现成为显现。以这种方式，你就会怀着敬畏和开放的态度进入内识的神秘，并以务实和具体的方式参与世界。这将使你成为从你古老家园到这个暂时世界的桥梁。然后，你将以敬畏和崇敬的心态看待宇宙中的生命，并以简明和负责任的态度对待你在世界中的自我应用。在这里，你的所有能力将得到正确的培养和整合，你将成为内识的载体。</p><p>We will now begin a more advanced section of your curriculum. You may realize that much of what you are learning you cannot yet understand. Many of the steps to follow will be to activate your Knowledge, to make it stronger and more present within you and to evoke within you the ancient memory of your true relationships in the universe and the meaning of your purpose here. Therefore, We will begin a series of lessons which you will not be able to comprehend but with which you must become engaged. You are now penetrating the mystery of your life. The mystery of your life holds all the promise for your life.</p><p>我们现在将开始你课程中更先进的部分。你可能会意识到，许多你正在学习的内容你暂时还无法理解。接下来的一些步骤将激活你的内识，使其在你体内变得更强大和更为显现，并唤起你对宇宙中真正关系的古老记忆，以及你在这里目的的意义。因此，我们将开始一系列你目前无法理解的课程，但你必须参与其中。你现在正在深入你生命的神秘。你生命的神秘持有着你生命的所有承诺。</p><p>Remember your lesson throughout the day. Recite it upon the hour and in your two deeper practice periods, enter into stillness and peace. Allow yourself to penetrate the mystery of your life so that the mystery of your life may be revealed to you. For all meaning, purpose and direction are born of your origin and your destiny. You are a visitor within the world, and your participation here must exemplify your greater life beyond the world. In this way, the world is blessed and fulfilled. In this way, you will not betray yourself, for you were born of a greater life, and Knowledge is abiding with you to remind you of this.</p><p>一整天都要记住你的课程。每隔一小时朗诵一次，在两次更深入的练习中，进入静止与和平。允许你自己深入生命的神秘，以便你生命的神秘得以向你揭示。因为所有的意义、目的和方向都源于你的起源和你的天命。你是这个世界的访客，你在这里的参与必须体现你超越这个世界的伟大生命。以这种方式，世界才会得到祝福和圆满。以这种方式，你才不会背叛你自己，因为你是从一个更伟大的生命中诞生的，内识与你同在，提醒你这一点。</p><p>Practice 295: Two 30-minute practice periods.

I will learn of the meaning and the purpose of Knowledge through my participation. I will follow my participation without attempting to alter its methods or its lessons in any way because I wish to learn. I am a student of Knowledge in a world where Knowledge seems to be absent. For this reason I have been sent here to prepare to give that which Knowledge will wish to give to the world. I am a student of Knowledge. I am secure in my responsibility. In this, I will receive all that I truly desire, for I truly desire to love the world.”</p><p>“我现在是一名内识的学生。我将通过参与来学习内识的意义和目的。我将遵循我的参与，不试图以任何方式改变其方法或课程，因为我希望学习。在这个似乎没有内识的世界里，我是一名内识的学生。因此，我被派到这里，准备给予内识将要给予世界的礼物。我是一名内识的学生。我在我的责任中感到安稳。在此，我将获得我真正渴望的一切，因为我真正渴望去爱这个世界。”</p><p>Following this invocation begin your two-week Review. Beginning with the first day in this two-week period, read the lesson for that day and remember your practice. Continue on in this way to cover all the days in this two-week period, and then attempt to have an overview of your life during this practice time. Begin to see what has occurred in your life in this twoweek period. </p><p>在这段祈祷词之后，开始你的两周回顾。从这两周中的第一天开始，阅读当天的课程并回顾你的练习。以这种方式继续下去，覆盖这两周的所有日子，然后尝试对你在这段时间内的生命进行概览。开始观察这两周内你的生命发生了什么。</p><p>As you gain an overview, you will begin to see the movement of your life. Perhaps this will be subtle at first, but you will soon begin to realize that your life is progressing rapidly and that your values and your experience of yourself are changing. You are changing fundamentally. You are finally becoming yourself. You will realize that war, which still rages in you from time to time, will diminish and become less frequent. Only with a conscious and objective overview can this be recognized, and as it is recognized, it will give you the confidence and the conviction to proceed on, for you will know that you are following your true course and your true destiny. You will know that you are a true student of Knowledge and that you have made the right decision concerning your studenthood.</p><p>当你纵观全局时，你就会开始看到你生命的轨迹。这个过程一开始或许会很微妙，但你很快会意识到你的生命正在迅速前进，你的价值观和你对你自己的体验正在发生改变。你正在从根本上发生变化。你终于成为了你自己。你会意识到内心的战争虽然偶尔仍会爆发，但会逐渐减少且变得不那么频繁。只有通过有意识且客观的回顾才能认识到这一点。当你知道这一点时，它将赋予你信心和信念，让你继续前进，因为你会知道你正走在真正的道路上，追随着真正的天命。你会知道你是一名真正的内识学生，并且已经在学生身份上做出了正确的决定。</p><p>Practice 294: One long practice period.</p><p>练习 294 ： 一个漫长的练习期</p>]]></content>

Do not let the world draw you into its meaningless pursuits, into its hopeless endeavors or into its incensed conflicts. All these things still hold attraction for you, yet do not allow yourself to give into them today, for the persuasions of the world are born of the world’s great anxiety and fear. Anxiety and fear are like diseases that affect minds. Do not allow your mind to be so affected today. You do not want to suffer today, and suffer you will if you follow the world’s persuasions. Participate in the world and fulfill your mundane responsibilities, but strengthen your resolve to be a student of Knowledge, for this will free you from all suffering and will give you the greatness that you are intended to give to the world. </p><p>通过成为内识的学生，遵循内识并将你自己奉献给内识，来增强你不想受苦的决心。不要让世界将你引入它那无意义的追求中，进入那些无望的努力或充满怒火的冲突。所有这些追求依然对你有吸引力，但今天不要让你自己屈服于它们，因为世界的诱惑源自世界的巨大焦虑和恐惧。焦虑和恐惧就像疾病一样影响着心灵。今天不要让你的心灵被这些影响。你不想要受苦，然而如果你试图在没有内识的情况下投入到世界中，你必然会受苦。参与世界并履行你日常的责任，但要增强你作为内识学生的决心，因为这将使你脱离一切痛苦，并赋予你可以给世界带来的伟大。</p><p>Upon the hour confirm that you do not want to suffer today and realize the inevitability of your suffering if you attempt to engage yourself in the world without Knowledge. The world can only remind you of your one great purpose and responsibility now, which is to become a student of Knowledge. Be grateful that the world will support you in the only way that it can, and be grateful that from your Ancient Home, God has extended Grace into the world for you to receive and to learn to give.</p><p>每到整点时确认你今天不想要受苦，并意识到如果你试图在没有内识的情况下让你自己融入世界，你的痛苦是不可避免的。世界现在只能提醒你，你唯一伟大的目的和责任，那就是成为内识的学生。感谢这个世界将以它唯一能做的方式支持你，感谢上帝从你古老的家园将恩典延伸到这个世界，让你去接受并学习如何给予。</p><p>Practice 293: Hourly practice. </p><p>练习 293 ：每小时练习。</p>]]></content>

When you recognize how much the world is serving you, which can only be recognized in the context of Knowledge, you will then end all of your hatred towards the world, all of your condemnation of the world and all of your resistance to the world. This will confirm your true destiny, your true origin and your true purpose for being in the world.</p><p>当世界为你服务时，你怎么能对世界感到愤怒呢？只有在内识的背景下，你才能认识到世界是如何为你服务的，当你认识到这一点时，你就会结束对世界的所有仇恨、对世界的所有谴责以及对世界的所有抵制。这将确认你真正的天命、你真正的起源和你来到这个世界的真正目的。</p><p>You have come into the world to learn and to unlearn. You have come into the world to recognize what is real and what is not. You have come into the world to be a contributor to the world, a contributor who has been sent from beyond the world to serve here. This is the real nature of your presence here, and though it may seem to conflict with your evaluation of yourself, it is true nonetheless and will be true regardless of your point of view, regardless of your own ideals and beliefs and regardless of whatever pursuits you may set for yourself. The truth awaits you and waits for you to be ready to value it.</p><p>你来到这个世界，是为了学习和摆脱学习。你来到这个世界是为了认清什么是真实的，什么是不真实的。你来到这个世界是为了成为一个贡献者，一个从世界之外被派来为这里服务的贡献者。这就是你在这里存在的真实自然。尽管这似乎与你对你自己的评价相冲突，但无论你的观点如何，无论你自身有怎样的理想和信念，无论你为你自己设定了怎样的追求，它仍然是真实的，也将是真正的。真理正在等待着你，等待着你准备好去珍惜它。</p><p>Upon the hour remember today’s idea and see its application everywhere as you look about at the world. In your two deeper practices, once again bring to mind every person that you feel has erred against you, and once again attempt to understand their contribution to you in bringing you to Knowledge, in teaching you to value Knowledge and in teaching you to realize that there is no hope beyond Knowledge. There is no hope without Knowledge. Today’s idea will engender love and gratitude towards the world and will strengthen this point of view, which will be necessary for you to have to look upon the world with certainty, love and Knowledge.</p><p>每小时提醒自己今天的想法，并在观察世界时看到它的应用。在你的两次更深入的练习中，再次想起每一个你觉得对你有过错误的人，再次尝试理解他们对你的贡献，是他们把你带到了内识的世界，教你珍惜内识，教你认识到在内识之外就没有希望。没有内识就没有希望。今天的想法将唤起你对世界的爱和感激之情，并将强化你的这个观点，而这正是你以确定、爱和内识来看待世界所必需的。</p><p>Practice 292: Two 30-minute practice periods. Hourly practice. </p><p>练习 292 ：两次 30 分钟的练习时段。每小时练习。</p>]]></content>

Here all folly, error, confusion, ambivalence, conflict and war in the world can lead you to the conviction of Knowledge. In this way, the world serves you, supports you and prepares you to serve it in its great need. Here you become a recipient of the world’s accomplishments and are given a reminder of the world’s errors. In this way, your love and compassion for the world will be engendered.</p><p>在这一点上，所有对你犯错的人都会成为你的朋友，因为即使在他们的痛苦中，他们也在为你服务，并将召唤你去服务他们。在这里，所有的愚昧、错误、混乱、矛盾、冲突和战争都能引导你坚定信念，追随内识。通过这种方式，世界为你服务，支持你，并准备你在其伟大的需求中为世界服务。在这里，你成为世界成就的接受者，并获得对世界错误的提醒。通过这种方式，你对世界的爱与同情将得到培养。</p><p>Today remind yourself upon the hour of this message and attempt to realize its meaning in the context of all of your activities so that everything that happens today will demonstrate the meaning of today’s idea. In your deeper practice periods, actively engage your mind in attempting to penetrate today’s idea. Recall every person who you think has erred against you. See how that person has served you and will continue to serve you as a reminder. This can save you great amounts of time and energy by bringing you closer to Knowledge, by increasing your resolve for Knowledge and by reminding you that there is no alternative to Knowledge. In your longer practice periods think of every person who you feel has erred against you and realize their tremendous service to you from this point of view. </p><p>今天，每时每刻都要提醒你自己这条讯息，并尝试在你所有的活动中意识到它的意义，以便今天发生的每一件事都能展示今天想法的意义。在你更深入的练习期间，积极地运用你的心灵去渗透今天的想法。回忆每一个你认为对你犯错的人。看看那个人是如何为你服务的，并将继续作为提醒为你服务。从这个角度来看，这可以为你节省大量的时间和精力，让你更接近内识，增强你对内识的决心，并提醒你没有任何替代选择可以取代内识。在你较长的练习时间中，思考每一个你认为对你犯下错误的人，并从这个角度意识到他们为你提供的巨大服务。</p><p>Allow this day to be a day of forgiveness and a day of acceptance where you recognize and extend your gratitude to those who have erred against you. Life is conspiring to bring you to Knowledge. As you enter Knowledge, you will realize the great service that life is rendering unto you, both from its accomplishments and from its failures. Be a recipient of this gift, for in love and gratitude you will turn to the world and wish to contribute that which is the greatest of all contributions. Here you will give Knowledge in gratitude and in service to the world which has served you.</p><p>让今天成为宽恕和接受的一天，在这一天里，你认识并扩展你的感激之情，感谢那些对你犯错的人。生命正在策划让你进入内识。当你进入内识时，你将意识到生命对你所做的伟大服务，无论是从它的成就还是它的失败中。成为这个礼物的接受者，因为在爱与感恩中，你将转向世界，并希望做出最伟大的贡献。在这里，你将以感恩和服务的心态将内识献给曾为你服务的世界。</p><p>Practice 291: Two 30-minute practice periods.

Every day, every hour and every minute you are learning and attempting to assimilate your learning. You are either a student of Knowledge or a student of confusion. You are either a student of certainty or a student of ambivalence. You are either a student of wholeness and integrity or you are a student of conflict and war. You can only learn from being in the world, and you can only demonstrate the result of your learning. </p><p>在这个世界上，你是一名学生——永远如此。每一天、每一小时、每一分钟，你都在学习并努力吸收你的学习成果。你要么是内识的学生，要么是混乱的学生。你要么是确定性的学生，要么是矛盾的学生。你要么是整体性和完整性的学生，要么是冲突与战争的学生。你只能通过在世界中学习来获得内识，而你只能展示你学习的结果。</p><p>Therefore, there is no choice whether you will be a student or not, for you will be a student even if you decide not to be a student. If you decide not to be a student, you will merely study another curriculum. In this, you have no choice, for to be in the world is to learn and to demonstrate the result of your learning. Recognizing this, your decision, then, is to determine where you will be a student and what you will learn. This is the power of decision that is given to you. Knowledge will naturally guide you to make the right decision and will lead you unto itself, for it is given to you to give to the world. Thus, as you approach Knowledge, you will feel as if you are engaged in a great homecoming. You will feel a great integration within yourself, and you will feel your self-conflict and your war with yourself begin to diminish and to fade. </p><p>因此，是否成为学生并没有选择权，因为即使你决定不做学生，你依然会是学生。如果你决定不做学生，你只会学习另一种课程。在这一点上，你没有选择，因为在世界中生活就是学习并展示你的学习成果。认识到这一点后，你的决定就是决定你将在何处做学生，以及你将学习什么。这是赋予你的决策权。内识会自然地引导你做出正确的决定，并将你引领到它自己，因为它被赐予你，是为了让你将它带给世界。因此，当你接近内识时，你会觉得你自己正在经历一次伟大的归属感。你会感觉到内心的整合，感觉到你的自我冲突和与你自己的战争开始减弱并逐渐消失。</p><p>Be a student of Knowledge today, for a student you are. Choose the curriculum that has chosen you. Choose the curriculum that will redeem you and through you the world. Choose the curriculum that fulfills your purpose here and that exemplifies your life beyond this world, which wishes to express itself here. Become a student of Knowledge. </p><p>今天做内识的学生，因为你本来就是学生。选择那已经选择你的课程。选择那将拯救你并通过你拯救世界的课程。选择那将完成你在这里的目的，并彰显你超越这个世界的生命，那个生命渴望在这里表达它自己。成为内识的一名学生。</p><p>Realize the power of today’s idea and remember it upon the hour. Always remember to read the day’s lesson prior to entering into the world so that you may begin to utilize its practice for that day. Confirm your studenthood in Knowledge. Strengthen your involvement as a student of Knowledge. Follow today’s practices with greater and greater devotion. </p><p>意识到今天想法的力量，并时刻牢记。永远记得在进入世界之前阅读今天的课程，这样你就可以开始运用当天的练习。确认你是内识的学生。加强你作为内识学生的投入。更加虔诚地跟随今天的练习。</p><p>In your two deeper practice periods, actively engage your mind in considering what it means to be a student in the world. Engage your mind in understanding the message for today, and attempt to realize that you are a student under all circumstances. Try to realize that you have no choice here, for you must learn, assimilate and demonstrate your learning. This is the foundation for true teaching. Realize that your purpose in the world is to become a student of Knowledge, to assimilate Knowledge and to allow Knowledge to express itself so that you may demonstrate Knowledge in the world. In the simplest way, this is an expression of your purpose, and from your purpose a specific calling will come forth to guide you in specific ways in the world according to your nature and your design.</p><p>在你两个更深层次的练习时段中，积极地让你的心灵参与思考做世界学生的意义。让你的心灵理解今天的讯息，并尝试意识到无论在任何情况下，你都是学生。试着意识到你在这里没有选择，因为你必须学习、吸收并展示你的学习成果。这是真正教学的基础。意识到你在世界中的目的是成为内识的学生，吸收内识，并让内识表达它自己，这样你就可以在世界中展示内识。以最简单的方式，这就是你目的的表现，而从你的目的中，一个特定的召唤将会显现，引导你根据你的自然和设计以特定的方式在世界中行事。</p><p>Thus, today you will strengthen yourself as a student of Knowledge. In your longer practice periods, actively engage your mind in attempting to penetrate today’s idea and to recognize its absolute relevancy to your life.</p><p>因此，今天你将强化你自己作为内识学生的角色。在你较长的练习时段中，积极调动你的心灵，尝试渗透今天的想法，并认识到它与你生命的绝对相关性。</p><p>Practice 290: Two 30-minute practice periods. Hourly practice.</p><p>练习 290 ：两个 30 分钟的练习时段。每小时练习。</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="STEP-289-TODAY-I-AM-A-STUDENT-OF-KNOWLEDGE"><a href="#STEP-289-TODAY-I-AM-A-STUDENT-OF-KNOWLEDGE" class="headerlink" title="STEP 289 TODAY I AM A STUDENT OF KNOWLEDGE."></a>STEP 289 TODAY I AM A STUDENT OF KNOWLEDGE.</h2><p>Be a real student today. Give yourself entirely to your learning process. Do not assume anything, for true students do not assume anything, and that is what enables them to learn everything. Realize that you cannot comprehend Knowledge; you can only receive it. You can only experience its extension through your life into the world. </p><p>今天做一名真实的学生。将你自己完全献给你的学习过程。不要假设任何事情，因为真正的学生不会假设任何事，这正是他们能够学习一切的原因。要意识到你无法理解内识；你只能接收它。你只能通过你的生命去体验它在世界上的延伸。</p><p>Therefore, allow yourself to be receptive to Knowledge. Do not allow yourself to be receptive to the ambivalence that permeates the world. Maintain your distance from this ambivalence, for you are not yet strong enough with Knowledge to face ambivalence and to render your gift into an ambivalent world. Do not be ambitious in this regard, or you will overstep your capacity and will fail as a result. As Knowledge grows and develops within you, it will lead you into areas where you are able to serve. It will lead you into situations where you have an adequate capacity to render it.</p><p>因此，允许你自己对内识保持开放。不要让你自己对充斥于世界的矛盾保持开放。与这种矛盾保持距离，因为你在内识中还不够强大，无法面对矛盾并在一个充满矛盾的世界中表达你的礼物。在这方面不要野心勃勃，否则你会超出你的能力范围并因此失败。随着内识在你内心的成长和发展，内识会引领你进入你能够服务的领域。它会引领你进入你有足够能力表达内识的情境。</p><p>Be a student today. Do not try to use the learning to fulfill your own ambitions with it. Do not let your own personal ideas guide you today, but be a student of Knowledge. When you are certain of something, carry it forth as wisely and as appropriately as possible. When you are uncertain of something, return to Knowledge and simply be at peace with Knowledge, for Knowledge will guide you. In this way, you will become a true and active agent of Knowledge in the world. Knowledge will extend itself through you into the world, and all that you receive will be given into the world through you.</p><p>今天做一名学生。不要试图利用学习来满足你自身的野心。今天，不要让你自身的个人想法动来左右你的行动，而要做一名内识的学生。当你对某事有把握时，要尽可能明智且恰当地去实现它。当你对某事不确定时，回归内识，与内识和平地在一起，因为内识会引导你。通过这种方式，你将成为一个真正的、积极的内识代理者。内识会通过你向世界延展，你所接收的一切也将通过你传递到世界。</p><p>In your deeper practices today strengthen your ability to enter into the realm of Knowledge. Today go deeper than you have ever gone before. Today be a student of Knowledge. Enter Knowledge. Experience Knowledge. In this way, you will become more and more engaged with its power and its grace. In this way, you will realize its purpose in the world, which can only be realized through participation.</p><p>今天在你更深层次的练习中，加强你进入内识领域的能力。今天比以往任何时候都要更深入。今天做一名内识的学生。进入内识。体验内识。通过这种方式，你将越来越多地与内识的力量和恩典相结合。通过这种方式，你将认识到它在世界中的目的，而这个目的只能通过参与来实现。</p><p>Practice 289: Two 30-minute practice periods. </p><p>练习 289 ：两个 30 分钟的练习时段</p>]]></content>

      <title>第二百八十八阶：敌人只是没有学会加入的朋友</title>
      <link href="/2025/01/12/288/"/>
      <url>/2025/01/12/288/</url>
      
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="STEP-288-ENEMIES-ARE-ONLY-FRIENDS-WHO-HAVE-NOT-LEARNED-TO-JOIN"><a href="#STEP-288-ENEMIES-ARE-ONLY-FRIENDS-WHO-HAVE-NOT-LEARNED-TO-JOIN" class="headerlink" title="STEP 288 ENEMIES ARE ONLY FRIENDS WHO HAVE NOT LEARNED TO JOIN."></a>STEP 288 ENEMIES ARE ONLY FRIENDS WHO HAVE NOT LEARNED TO JOIN.</h2><p>There are no true enemies in life, for all war and conflict are born of confusion. This you must understand. A life without Knowledge can only be confused and must create its own inner guidance system, which is merely the ideas and beliefs with which it identifies itself. Thus, individuals have their own individual purpose and self-identity. These evaluations clash with those of other individuals, and thus one to one, group to group, nation to nation and world to world, war is generated and waged. </p><p>生命中没有真正的敌人，因为所有的战争和冲突都源于混乱。你必须理解这一点。没有内识的生命只能是混乱的，必须创造出它自身的内在指导系统，而这个系统仅仅是它所认同的想法和信念。因此，个人有各自的目的和自我认同。这些评估与他人的评估发生冲突，于是，个人对个人、群体对群体、国家对国家、世界对世界，战争就此产生并展开。</p><p>In Knowledge this is not possible, for in Knowledge all are your friends. You recognize each person to be at whatever stage of development he or she is currently engaged. You may become involved with some of them, and with some of them you may not. Some of them may be able to receive your contribution directly, while others will need to receive it indirectly. But they are all your friends. There is no opposition in Knowledge, for there is only one Knowledge in the universe. It expresses itself through each individual. As each individual becomes more purified as a vehicle for Knowledge, as each individual becomes a greater recipient of Knowledge and as each individual follows Knowledge and becomes responsible to Knowledge, then the opportunity for him or her to be in conflict will diminish and eventually will disappear. </p><p>在内识中，这是不可能的，因为在内识中，所有人都是你的朋友。你认识到每个人都处在他们当前所处的任何发展阶段。你可能会与其中一些人互动，可能不会与其他人互动。有些人能够直接接受你的贡献，而有些人则需要间接地接受它。但他们都是你的朋友。在内识中没有对立，因为宇宙中只有一种内识。它通过每个个体来表达。当每个个体成为更纯净的内识载体，当每个个体成为更伟大的内识接收者，并且当每个个体跟随内识并对内识负责时，那么他或她发生冲突的机会将减少，最终消失。</p><p>Recognize, then, that all war and conflict simply express a lack of capacity for those involved to join. When individuals join, they recognize a common need, which becomes their primary need. This must be born of Knowledge and not idealism if it is to be actualized. It must be born of Knowledge and not mere philosophy if it is to lead to true action and true involvement. Thus, you become a peacemaker and a peacekeeper in the world as you follow as a student of Knowledge. The stronger Knowledge is within you, the weaker will be your fear and ambivalence. In this way, war within you will be ended, and your life will be a demonstration that war is unnecessary. </p><p>因此，要认识到，所有的战争和冲突只是参与者缺乏加入能力的表现。当个人加入时，他们认识到共同的需求，而这成为他们的主要需求。如果它要得以实现，它必须源于内识，而非理想主义。如果它要导致真正的行动和真正的参与，它必须源于内识，而非单纯的哲学。因此，当你作为内识的学生跟随时，你将成为世界上的和平缔造者与和平维护者。你内在的内识越强，你的恐惧和矛盾就会越弱。通过这种方式，你内心的战争将结束，你的生命将成为战争不必要的证明。</p><p>Dedicate yourself today to ending war within the world by ending war within yourself so that you may be a peacemaker and a peacekeeper. Upon the hour remind yourself of today’s lesson and apply it to the world that you see around you. Apply it to all of the conflicts in the world of which you are aware. Try to understand its complete relevancy to these conflicts. This will require that you see these conflicts from a different point of view in order to realize the full impact and meaning of today’s idea. It is this point of view that you must cultivate, for you must learn to see as Knowledge sees, to think as Knowledge thinks and to act as Knowledge acts. All this you will most certainly accomplish as you follow Knowledge each day.</p><p>今天，请将你自己献身于通过结束内心的战争来结束世界上的战争，这样你就可以成为和平缔造者与和平维护者。在每小时中提醒你自己今天的课程，并将其应用于你周围的世界。将其应用于你所知道的世界中所有的冲突。试图理解这些冲突与今天想法的完全相关性。为了意识到今天想法的完整影响和意义，这将要求你从不同的角度来看待这些冲突。正是这个观点你必须培养，因为你必须学会像内识看到的那样看，像内识思考的那样思考，像内识行动的那样行动。随着你每天跟随内识，你就一定能做到这一点。</p><p>In your deeper practice periods return to stillness and silence so that you may strengthen your ability to cultivate and prepare yourself to be an emissary of Knowledge in the world. This is your responsibility today. This will permeate all of your other activities and give them value and meaning, for today you are a student of Knowledge.</p><p>在你更深层次的练习时段，回到静止和寂静，以便增强你培养并准备成为内识使者的能力。这是你今天的责任。这将渗透到你所有的其他活动中，并赋予它们价值和意义，因为今天你是内识的学生。</p><p>Practice 288: Two 30-minute practice periods. Hourly practice. </p><p>练习 288 ：两个 30 分钟的练习时段。每小时练习。</p>]]></content>

You cannot be at war within yourself or with others, for with Knowledge there is only Knowledge and there is confusion in the world. Confusion does not require attack. Therefore, with Knowledge you are not at war, for you have one mind, one purpose, one responsibility, one direction and one meaning. The more your mind becomes uniform, the more your external life will become uniform as well. How can you be at war within yourself when you are following Knowledge? War is born of ambivalence where opposing value systems conflict with each other to gain your recognition. Competing ideas, competing emotions and competing values all wage war on one another, and you are caught in the middle of their great battles. </p><p>有了内识，你就无法与你自己或他人争斗，因为在内识面前，只有内识，而世界充满了混乱。混乱不需要攻击。因此，有了内识，你不再处于战争状态，因为你拥有一个心灵、一个目的、一份责任、一个方向和一个意义。你的心灵越是统一，你的外在生命也会越统一。当你跟随内识时，如何能在你内心中与你自己争斗呢？战争源于矛盾，当相互对立的价值体系互相冲突时，价值体系就会彼此来争夺你的认可。相互竞争的想法、相互竞争的情感和相互竞争的价值观都在彼此开战，而你则被夹在它们的大战之中。</p><p>With Knowledge all of this is escaped. With Knowledge you cannot be at war within yourself. In time, all of your self-doubt, uncertainty, fear and anxiety will wear away. As they do so, you will increasingly feel that you are not at war and will enjoy the full benefit of being at peace. This will enable you to turn your eyes upon the world with the full force of your involvement, for all of your mental and physical energy will now be available for you to contribute to the world. What you will contribute will be greater than your actions or your words, for you will carry stillness and peace into the world. </p><p>有了内识，这一切都可以逃脱。有了内识，你无法与你自己争斗。随着时间的推移，你所有的自我怀疑、不确定性、恐惧和焦虑将会消失。随着它们的消失，你会越来越感觉到你没有战争，享受完全的和平带来的益处。这将使你能够全身心的投入，将目光投向世界，因为你所有的心理和生理能量现在都可以为世界做出贡献。你将贡献的，将不仅仅是你的行为或言辞，因为你将把静止与和平带入世界。</p><p>Here you will not be in opposition to anyone, though others may choose to be in opposition to you. Here you will not be at war with anyone, even if others choose to be at war with you. This will be your greatest contribution, and this is what your life will teach through demonstration. Here Knowledge will bestow itself upon the world and teach the great lessons that you are now learning to receive for yourself. This teaching will occur naturally. You need not force it upon the world, and you need not attempt to change anyone else, for Knowledge will accomplish its true task through you.</p><p>在这里，你不会与任何人对立，尽管他人可能选择与你对立。在这里，你不会与任何人争斗，即使他人选择与你争斗。这将是你最大的贡献，这也是你的生命将通过示范教导的内容。在这里，内识将赐予世界，并传授你现在正在学习接收的伟大课程。这种教导将自然而然地发生。你不必把它强加给这个世界，也不必试图改变任何人，因为内识将通过你完成它的真正任务。</p><p>Upon the hour realize the meaning of today’s idea and realize the power of Knowledge to end all of your suffering and eventually the suffering of the world. In your deeper practice periods, return to your great sanctuary and once again become a recipient of Knowledge in openness and humility. Then you will be able to carry your abiding relationship with Knowledge into the world with greater and greater certainty. Then what needs to be contributed will radiate from you effortlessly.</p><p>在每个小时，意识到今天想法的意义，意识到内识的力量可以结束你所有的痛苦，并最终结束世界的痛苦。在你更深层次的练习阶段，回到你伟大的圣所，再次以开放和谦逊的心态成为内识的接收者。这样，你将能够以更大的确定性将你与内识的永恒关系带入世界。然后，你需要贡献的内识将毫不费力地从你身上散发出来。</p><p>Practice 287: Two 30-minute practice periods. Hourly practice.</p><p>练习 287 ：两个 30 分钟的练习时段。每小时练习。</p>]]></content>

Allow your inner life to be quiet as you move in the world of turbulence and confusion. There is nothing for you to resolve in your thoughts now, for you are learning to be with Knowledge. Knowledge will organize your thinking and give it true uniformity and direction. Carry stillness with you and be certain that all of your internal conflicts will be resolved through Knowledge, for you are following the source of their resolution. Each day will bring you closer to peace and fulfillment. And that which haunted you before and cast great dark clouds over your mind will simply be escaped as you walk the path of Knowledge.</p><p>带着静止前行。当你在纷乱与困惑的世界中行走时，让你的内在生命保持安静。现在，你不需要在思想中解决任何问题，因为你正在学习与内识同在。内识会组织你的思维，并赋予它真正的统一性与方向感。带着静止前行，并确信你所有的内在冲突都将通过内识得到解决，因为你正在追随解决它们的源泉。每一天都会让你更接近和平与满足。而那些曾经困扰你、在你心灵中投下巨大阴影的事物，将会随着你走上内识之路而逐渐消失。</p><p>Carry stillness with you into the world. This will enable you to be truly observant. This will enable you to see the world as it is. This will enable you to diffuse the world’s conflict, for here you are teaching peace by being at peace. This is not a false peace that you are teaching. It is born of a true association with Knowledge, for you are following Knowledge here. You are allowing Knowledge to provide the direction. You can only do this in stillness. </p><p>带着静止进入世界。这将使你能够真正地观察。这将使你能够看见世界的本来面貌。这将使你能够化解世界的冲突，因为在这里，你是在通过和平来教导和平。这不是一种虚假的和平，它诞生于与内识的真正联系，因为你在这里追随的是内识。你正在让内识提供方向，而你只能在静止中做到这一点。</p><p>Think not that stillness will render you incapable of genuine activity in the world. You will be active in the world, and you will participate in its mechanism, but you may be still inside as you do so. You will find, to your great delight, that you will be far more competent, more effective and far more responsive to others, with greater involvement and productivity as you carry this stillness into the world. Here your energy may be expressed in the world in a meaningful way. Here all the powers of your mind and your body are being contributed and are not wasted in internal conflict. Therefore, you become more powerful and effective, more certain and productive as you carry stillness into the world.</p><p>不要认为静止会让你无法在世界中进行真正的活动。你将活跃在这个世界上，你将参与这个世界的机制，但在此过程中，你的内心可以保持静止。你会发现，这将带给你伟大的喜悦——当你带着静止进入世界时，你会变得更加能干、更有效率、对他人更具响应能力，同时也会更投入且更有成效。在这里，你的能量可以在世界上得到有意义的表达。在这里，你的心灵和身体的所有力量都在为世界做出贡献，而不是浪费在内部的冲突之中。因此，当你带着静止进入世界时，你将变得更有力量、更有效、更确定、更有成效。</p><p>Throughout the day remind yourself that you are carrying stillness into the world, and in your two deep meditation practices seek the refuge of stillness. Escape the world that your senses report, and enter the serenity and the sanctuary of stillness and Knowledge. You will find as you proceed that your two longer practice periods will be times of great rest and relief, great moments of rejuvenation. They are where you attend the holy chapel of the Holy Spirit each day. They are where you and God meet through Knowledge.</p><p>一整天都要提醒你自己，你正在将静止带入世界。在你的两次深入冥想练习中，寻求静止的庇护。远离感官报告的世界，进入静止和内识的宁静与庇护。随着你不断前行，你会发现这两段较长的练习将成为极大的休憩与放松的时刻，是焕发活力的重要时刻。在这里，你每天都会在圣灵的圣殿中驻足。在这里，通过内识，你与上帝相会。</p><p>These practice periods, then, become the highlight of each day as you learn to receive the gifts that are being presented to you. You will look forward to your practice sessions as an opportunity to regenerate and to refresh yourself, to find true inspiration and comfort and to enable your mind to become stronger and stronger with Knowledge so that you may carry peace and stillness into the world.</p><p>因此，这些练习时段将成为每天的亮点，因为你在学习接受那些正在向你呈现的礼物。你会期待这些练习，它们是你恢复活力、焕发新生的机会，是你获得真正启发与安慰的时间，也是让你的心灵通过内识变得越来越强大的途径，从而使你能够将和平与静止带入世界。</p><p>Practice 286: Two 30-minute practice periods.

Then Knowledge will find expression in your specific thoughts and activities. Your mind was meant to serve Knowledge, as your body was meant to serve your mind. In this, the contribution from your True Home is able to express itself in the world of exile. Here Heaven and Earth touch, and when they touch, true communication begins to exist, and the transference of Knowledge is made into the world. </p><p>在静止中，一切皆可知晓，因为心灵能够回应内识。内识将通过你的特定思想和活动找到表达的方式。你的心灵本应服务于内识，就如同你的身体本应服务于你的心灵一样。这样，来自你真正家园的贡献就能在流放的世界中表现出来。在这里，天堂与地球相接，当它们相接时，真正的沟通开始存在，内识的传递得以进入这个世界。</p><p>You are preparing to become a vehicle for Knowledge so that all things that you accomplish, great and small, unique and mundane, will express the presence of Knowledge. Therefore, your function in the world is not grand; it is simple. It is what is expressed through your activity that is important, for the simplest action done with Knowledge is a great teaching of Knowledge and will impress and affect all minds in the world. </p><p>你正准备成为内识的载体，这样你所完成的所有事情，不论大小，独特或平凡，都将表达内识的存在。因此，你在世界上的运作并不宏大，它是简单的。重要的是通过你的活动表达出来的内识，因为用内识所做的最简单的行动就是内识的伟大教导，会给世界上所有的心灵留下深刻的印象和影响。</p><p>Therefore, remind yourself upon the hour today of the importance of cultivating stillness and the immediate freedom from anxiety and conflict that it provides for you. Allow your deeper practice periods today to be times of true devotion, where you come to the altar of God to give yourself. This, in essence, is the true church. This is the true chapel. This is where prayer becomes real and where your mind, which is an expression of God’s Mind, in stillness, humility and openness, yields itself to its great source. In this, God blesses you and gives to you a gift to give to the world which is the result of your own development. </p><p>因此，今天每时每刻都要提醒你自己培养静止的重要性，以及静止为你带来的免于焦虑和冲突的直接自由。让你今天的深入练习成为真正的奉献时间，让你来到上帝的圣坛面前给予你自己。这才是真正的教堂。这才是真正的礼拜。这才是真正的祈祷，也是你的心灵——上帝心灵的体现——在静止、谦逊和开放中向伟大的源泉屈服的地方。在这里，上帝赐福于你，并将你自身发展的成果作为礼物赠送给世界。</p><p>All this is transpired in stillness, for in stillness the transference of Knowledge can be completed. This is absolutely natural and totally beyond your comprehension. Therefore, you need not spend energy and time speculating about it, wondering about it or trying to comprehend its mechanism. This is not necessary. It is only required that you be a recipient of Knowledge. Do not stand apart and attempt to understand it. </p><p>这一切都在静止中发生，因为在静止中，内识的传递可以完成。这绝对是自然而然的，完全超出了你的理解范围。因此，你不必花费精力和时间去猜测它、琢磨它或试图理解它的机制。这是没有必要的。你只需要成为内识的接受者。不要站在一边试图理解它。</p><p>Do not stand apart today but enter stillness, for this is God’s gift to you. In stillness, the transference of Knowledge will be made. With this, you become a vehicle for Knowledge in the world.</p><p>今天，不要站在一边，而是进入静止，因为这是上帝给你的礼物。在静止中，内识将被传递。通过这一点，你成为世界上内识的载体。</p><p>Practice 285: Two 30-minute practice periods.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="STEP-284-STILLNESS-IS-MY-GIFT-TO-THE-WORLD"><a href="#STEP-284-STILLNESS-IS-MY-GIFT-TO-THE-WORLD" class="headerlink" title="STEP 284 STILLNESS IS MY GIFT TO THE WORLD."></a>STEP 284 STILLNESS IS MY GIFT TO THE WORLD.</h2><p>How can stillness be a gift, you may ask. It is a gift because it is an expression of certainty and peace. How can stillness be a gift to the world? Because your stillness allows Knowledge to express itself through you. How can stillness be a gift to the world? Because your stillness enables all other minds to be still so that they may know. A mind in conflict cannot be still. A mind that is desperately seeking for resolution cannot be still. A mind that is turbulent with its own evaluations cannot be still. Thus, as you present the stillness that you are now cultivating to the world, you give all other minds that recognize you the opportunity and the demonstration that will enable them to enter stillness themselves. You are, in essence, communicating that peace and freedom are possible and that there is a great presence of Knowledge in the world, calling upon each separated and tormented mind.</p><p>你或许会问，静止怎么会是一份礼物？它是一份礼物，因为它是确定性与和平的表现。静止如何能成为世界的礼物？因为你的静止让内识通过你来表达它自己。静止如何能成为世界的礼物？因为你的静止使得所有其他的心灵也能静止，以便它们能够知道。一个处于冲突中的心灵无法静止。一个迫切寻求解决方案的心灵无法静止。一个被自我评估搅动的心灵无法静止。因此，当你将你现在正在培养的静止呈现给世界时，你给所有认识你的人提供了一个机会和示范，使他们也能够进入静止。你本质上是在传达，和平与自由是可能的，并且在这个世界上有一种伟大的内识存在，召唤每一个分离和痛苦的心灵。</p><p>Your stillness is a gift. It will calm all minds. It will still all controversies. It will have a calming, soothing effect on all who suffer under the weight of their own imagination. This, then, is a great gift. It is not your only gift, for you will also give through your ideas, your actions and your accomplishments in the world. Here you will demonstrate the evolving qualities of mind that are required of you as a student of Knowledge. Yet of all that you may contribute to the world, your stillness will have the greatest effect, for in stillness you will resonate with all other minds, you will calm all other minds and you will be extending true peace into the world and the freedom that it demonstrates.</p><p>你的静止是一份礼物。它将平静所有心灵，平息所有争论，给所有在他们自身想象的重压下受苦的人带来安抚、抚慰的效果。因此，这是一份伟大的礼物。它不是你唯一的礼物，因为你还会通过你的想法、你的行动和你在世界上的成就来给予。在这里，你将展示作为一名内识学生所要求的心灵不断发展的特质。然而，在你所能给予世界的一切中，你的静止将产生最大的影响，因为在静止中你将与所有其他心灵产生共鸣，平静所有其他心灵，并将真正的和平与自由带入世界，并展现出它的样子。</p><p>Today remember the importance of stillness upon the hour. Look about at the world of turbulence and realize its great application there. In your two deeper meditation practices, give yourself again to stillness. Allow yourself to escape the ambivalence and uncertainty that haunt you and that hold you back. Come closer to the realm of stillness, which is the realm of Knowledge, for there you will find peace and certainty. This is God’s gift to you, and this will be your gift to the world.</p><p>今天，请记住静止的重要性，在每个小时中都要牢记这一点。环顾四周，看看动荡的世界，意识到静止在其中的伟大应用。在你两次深度冥想的练习中，再次允许你自己进入静止。允许你自己摆脱那些困扰你、阻碍你前进的模糊不清和不确定性。靠近静止的领域，这是内识的领域，因为在内识中你将找到和平与确定性。这是上帝赐给你的礼物，而这也将是你给予世界的礼物。</p><p>Practice 284: Two 30-minute practice periods.

It wishes to have this and wishes to go there. It wants to keep everything it has acquired and lose nothing, and yet it wants more than it needs. It is confused as to its predicament. It is confused as to the remedy. It is confused as to its identity. It is confused as to what to value and what not to value. All arguments and debates, all conflicts and all wars are engaged in exercising this ambivalence. </p><p>环顾四周，你会看到人类的世界陷入了它自身的矛盾之中。人类既希望拥有这一切，又渴望去追寻其他的一切。它想要确保已经获得的一切，却又不愿失去任何东西，同时又想要超出所需的更多。人类对它的困境感到困惑，对解决之道感到迷茫，对它的身份感到不确定。它不清楚该重视什么，又该忽视什么。所有的争论和辩论，所有的冲突和战争，都在彰显这种矛盾。</p><p>As you abide with Knowledge, you will look upon the world and recognize its utter confusion. This will teach you and remind you of the great need for Knowledge in the world. Knowledge will never attack itself, and Knowledge is not in conflict with itself. Therefore, two individuals, or two nations, or even two worlds, will have no issues of contention if they are guided by Knowledge, for Knowledge will always seek to join individuals in a meaningful way and to clarify their interactions with one another. It is not possible that Knowledge be in conflict with itself, for there is no opposition within Knowledge. It has one purpose and one aim, and to this it organizes all activity. It organizes all forms of opposition into serving one purpose and one direction. Thus, it is the great peacemaker in the world. As you abide with Knowledge, you will become the vehicle for its expression. Then you will teach peace because peace itself will be teaching through you.</p><p>当你与内识同在时，你将看到这个世界并认识到它的完全困惑。这会教导你并提醒你世界上对内识的伟大需求。内识永远不会与它自己对立，内识本身没有冲突。因此，如果两个个体、两个国家，甚至两个世界都受到内识的引导，他们将没有任何争执，因为内识总是寻求以有意义的方式将个体连接起来，澄清彼此之间的互动。内识不可能与它自己发生冲突，因为内识内部没有对立。它有一个目的和一个方向，所有的活动都围绕着这个目的和方向组织。它将所有的反对形式都组织成服务于一个目的和一个方向。因此，内识是世界上伟大的和平缔造者。当你与内识同在时，你将成为它表达的载体。然后，你将教导和平，因为和平本身将通过你来教导。</p><p>Looking at Knowledge like this will enable you to recognize your true involvement and your true responsibility as a student of Knowledge. The world is in ambivalence. It is in confusion and is suffering all of the results of this. But you who are now learning to witness the world without judgment or condemnation and are learning to witness the world from the certainty of Knowledge will be able to simply recognize the predicament of the world and know that you are carrying the remedy within yourself now.</p><p>以这种方式看待内识，你将能够认识到你作为内识学生的真正参与和真正责任。世界充满矛盾，充满困惑，并承受着所有由此带来的后果。但是，你现在正在学习从内识的确定性出发见证世界、没有评判、没有谴责，你将能够简单地识别世界的困境，并知道你自己的内在现在正携带着解决方法。</p><p>In your deeper practices enter into stillness once again and use the RAHN word if necessary to help you. Because you are learning to be still, you are learning to be certain. Any individual who can acquire stillness in the world will become a source of Knowledge in the world, for Knowledge will express itself in the world wherever there is an opening in any mind. Your mind is now becoming open so that Knowledge may express itself.</p><p>在更深层次的练习中，再次进入静止状态，必要时使用RAHN这个词语来帮助你。因为你正在学习静止，你正在学习确定。任何能够在世界中获得静止的人，都会成为世界上内识的源泉，因为内识会在任何有心灵开放的地方表达它自己。现在，你的心灵正在变得开放，以便内识能够在其中表达它自己。</p><p>Practice 283: Two 30-minute practice periods. </p><p>练习 283 ：两次 30 分钟的练习时段</p>]]></content>

Your responsibility is to follow Knowledge and to learn to express Knowledge adequately and purposefully. In this, your human abilities will need to be cultivated and elevated. Discernment and all the other qualities of value within yourself will need to be cultivated as well, for you must learn to express that which you carry. You must learn to follow it and become a worthy vehicle for it. This is the true meaning of all individual development. This is where individual development has genuine purpose. This is where your growth and advancement have direction as well. </p><p>在世界中承载内识需要承担责任。你的责任是追随内识，并学习如何充分且有目的地表达内识。在这过程中，你需要培养和提升你的各种人类能力。你自己内在的辨别力以及所有其他有价值的品质也需要被培养，因为你必须学会表达你所承载的内识。你必须学会追随它，并成为一个值得托付的载体。这是所有个人发展的真正意义所在。这是个人发展具有真正目的的地方，也是你的成长与进步找到方向的地方。</p><p>Therefore, allow yourself to experience the meaning of today’s idea. Allow yourself to accept responsibility. It is not a weight upon your shoulders. It is a rite of passage for you, and in this all things that have confused and frustrated you within yourself will be given a new and purposeful application. Realize that Knowledge carries responsibility. In this, you need to treat it with the seriousness that it requires, and yet with this seriousness, you receive the greatness and the peace that it will render to you. Over time, you will become a very, very finelytuned vehicle for Knowledge in the world. In this, all things that require development will find development, and all things which merely hinder your progress will be relinquished. </p><p>因此，允许你自己体验今天这个想法的意义。允许你自己接受责任。这并不是一种压在你肩上的负担，而是你成长的一个通道。在这个过程中，所有曾经让你感到困惑和挫败的事情都会被赋予新的、有意义的应用。要意识到内识承载着责任。对此，你需要以它所要求的严肃态度来对待。然而，伴随着这种严肃性，你也将从中获得伟大与和平。随着时间的推移，你将成为一个非常非常精密的内识载体。在这个过程中，所有需要发展的方面都会得到发展，而所有仅仅阻碍你进步的事物都会被放弃。</p><p>In your deeper practices in stillness today, recognize that you have a responsibility to cultivate your faculties of mind as a student of Knowledge. Exercise these responsibilities and do not drift away into imagination. Engage yourself as a student of Knowledge according to the requirements of your preparation, for you are now becoming a person of responsibility and a person of power.</p><p>在今天更深层次的静止练习中，认识到你作为内识学生有责任培养你的心灵能力。履行这些责任，不要漂入幻想之中。根据你的准备要求，让你自己全身心地参与到内识的学习中，因为你正在成为一个负责任的人，一个有力量的人。</p><p>Practice 282: Two 30-minute practice periods.</p><p>练习 282 ：两次 30 分钟的练习时段</p>]]></content>

You will seek Knowledge with total conviction when you realize that any other avenue of endeavor and any other use of your mind and body will be hopeless and will lead you into greater confusion. For without Knowledge, you can only learn that you need Knowledge, and with Knowledge, all true learning will proceed. Your past has already taught you the great need for Knowledge. You need not learn this again and again. Why repeat the same lesson over and over, thinking that it will yield for you a different result?</p><p>在一切之上，寻求内识，因为内识会给予你所需的一切。当你意识到任何其他努力以及对你身心的任何其他运用都是徒劳无功，并且只会让你陷入更大的困惑时，你将以全然的信念寻求内识。因为没有内识，你只能学到你需要内识，而与内识同在时，所有真正的学习才能进行。你的过去已经教导了你对内识的伟大需求。你不需要一遍又一遍地学习这一点。为什么要重复同样的课程，期望它会带来不同的结果？</p><p>Of yourself you can do nothing. Without Knowledge you can only generate more imagination. Therefore, there is one answer to your one greatest need, and the one answer will meet all other needs that emanate from your one great need. Your need is fundamental and the response to your need is fundamental. There is no complexity here, for in essence you need Knowledge to live meaningfully. You need Knowledge to advance. You need Knowledge to realize your True Self. You need Knowledge to fulfill your destiny in the world. Without Knowledge, you will simply wander around and come once again to realize that you need Knowledge. </p><p>凭你自己，你什么也做不了。没有内识，你只能创造出更多的想象。因此，你唯一最大的需求只有一个答案，这个答案将满足由你这个伟大需求延伸出的所有其他需求。你的需求是根本性的，对你的需求的回应也是根本性的。这其中没有复杂性，因为从本质上讲，你需要内识来有意义地生活。你需要内识来进步。你需要内识来实现你的真正自我。你需要内识来完成你在世界上的天命。没有内识，你将只是四处徘徊，最终再次意识到你需要内识。</p><p>This is a day of thanksgiving, for your prayers have been answered. Your need has been responded to. The gift has been given to you to reclaim your Knowledge. Above all else seek that which will serve everything through you. In this, your need and the remedy for your life will become simple, and you will be able to proceed in certainty and patience, becoming a consistent student of Knowledge. Day by day you are reclaiming your True Self. Day by day you are escaping all else that seeks to pull you into the darkness of confusion. Day by day that which is unreal begins to disintegrate and that which is genuine begins to emerge.</p><p>今天是感恩的一天，因为你的祈祷已经得到回应。你的需求已经被满足。你已经被赋予了重新找回内识的礼物。在一切之上，寻求将通过你服务于一切的内识。通过这一点，你的需求和生命的解决之道将变得简单，你将能够以确定性和耐心前行，成为一名始终如一的内识学生。一天又一天，你正在重新找回你真正的自我。一天又一天，你正在摆脱一切试图将你拉入困惑黑暗的事物。一天又一天，不真实的事物开始瓦解，真实的内识开始显现。</p><p>Upon the hour today remember and affirm this great truth—that you seek Knowledge above all else. In your deeper meditation practices, allow yourself to enter stillness. Allow your life to be transformed. Allow Knowledge to emerge so that you may be a vehicle for its expression, for in this you will find happiness.</p><p>今天每小时都要记住并确认这个伟大的真理——在一切之上，你寻求内识。在更深层次的冥想练习中，允许你自己进入静止。允许你的生命被转化。允许内识显现，使你成为其表达的载体，因为在这里你将找到幸福。</p><p>Practice 281: Two 30-minute practice periods.

Try to gain an overview of all that has transpired in the past two weeks. Try to see how you could deepen and improve your practice. Recognize how much time and energy are wasted in ambivalence and idle speculation. Realize how much of your energy is being wasted in doubt and confusion when you need only abide with Knowledge. Your ability to follow that which is beyond your comprehension, which is necessary here, will lead you to the greatest possible certainty that life can render to you. Through this certainty, your ideas, your actions and your perceptions will gain a uniformity that will allow them to be a powerful expression in the world, where humanity is confused and lost in the ambivalence of imagination. It is by following that you are able to give and you are able to lead. You will recognize this in time as you exercise your freedom and allow your freedom to exercise itself through you.</p><p>回顾过去两周，从复习阶段的第一课开始，每天都要回顾，直到最后一课。试着对过去两周所发生的一切进行概述。试着看看如何加深和改进你的练习。认识到有多少时间和能量浪费在矛盾和空想中。认识到你有多少能量浪费在怀疑和困惑中，而你只需要与内识相伴。你有能力去追随那些超出你理解的事物，它在这里是必要的，它将引导你获得生命所能给予你的最大的确定性。通过这种确定性，你的想法、你的行动和你的感知将获得一种统一性，使它们能够在这个世界上有力地表现出来，而在这个世界上，人类正处于困惑之中，迷失在想象的矛盾之中。正是因为追随，你才能够给予，你才能够领导。当你行使你的自由，并允许你的自由通过你行使时，你就会及时认识到这一点。</p><p>You are now a student of Knowledge. Dedicate yourself to the application of your preparation with increasing devotion and involvement. Allow the mistakes of your past to motivate you. They need not be and should not be a source of self-recrimination. They are intended now to be understood as the demonstration of your need for Knowledge. Thus, you may be very thankful that Knowledge is being given to you, for you are realizing that above all else it is Knowledge which you seek.</p><p>你现在是一名内识的学生。全心全意地投入到准备工作中，并不断提高参与度。让过去的错误激励你。它们不需要也不应该成为自责的根源。它们现在应该被理解为你需要内识的证明。因此，你可以非常感谢内识的赐予，因为你意识到，最重要的是你所寻求的是内识。</p><p>Practice 280: One long practice period.</p><p>练习 280 ： 一个漫长的练习期</p>]]></content>

      <title>第二百七十九阶：我必须体验我的自由才能意识到内识</title>
      <link href="/2024/12/29/279/"/>
      <url>/2024/12/29/279/</url>
      
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="STEP-279-I-MUST-EXPERIENCE-MY-FREEDOM-TO-REALIZE-IT"><a href="#STEP-279-I-MUST-EXPERIENCE-MY-FREEDOM-TO-REALIZE-IT" class="headerlink" title="STEP 279 I MUST EXPERIENCE MY FREEDOM TO REALIZE IT."></a>STEP 279 I MUST EXPERIENCE MY FREEDOM TO REALIZE IT.</h2><p>Freedom is not a concept or an idea. It is an experience. Therefore, it must be realized in many, many different circumstances for you to see its universal application. This you are given time to accomplish. This will make all of your activities meaningful, purposeful and valuable. Then you will have no foundation for condemning yourself or the world, for all things will strengthen your understanding of the necessity for Knowledge and all things will be the recipients of Knowledge. </p><p>自由不是一个概念或一个想法，它是一种体验。因此，必须在许多不同的情境中实现自由，才能看到它的普遍适用性。你有时间去完成这一点。这将使你所有的活动变得有意义、有目的并且有价值。这样，你就不会再有批评你自己或世界的基础，因为一切都会加强你对内识必要性的理解，一切都会成为内识的接受者。</p><p>Therefore, give yourself to practice, preparation and application. Do not identify merely with ideas, for even the greatest idea is meant to be an expression in changeable circumstances and will itself be unstable. To have genuine stability in the world, you must identify with Knowledge and allow Knowledge to demonstrate its power, its efficacy and its benevolence within the world. You must experience your freedom to value it and to comprehend its meaning in the world. This is why you are a student of Knowledge. And this is why you must apply everything that you are learning in your preparation here. </p><p>因此，把你自己交给实践、准备和应用。不要仅仅与想法认同，因为即使是最伟大的想法，它也应该在可变的环境中表现出来，并且想法本身是不稳定的。要在这个世界中拥有真正的稳定，你必须与内识认同，并允许内识在这个世界中展示它的力量、有效性和仁爱。你必须体验你的自由，才能珍视内识并理解它在世界中的意义。这就是你作为内识学生的原因。这也是你必须将你在这里所学的所有内容应用于实践的原因。</p><p>Remember this upon the hour as you are engaged in the world. Remember this in your deeper meditation practices where you are engaged in your inner life. In both arenas, Knowledge must prevail. In both arenas, your freedom must be exercised to be realized. In your deeper meditations, exercise the strength of your mind to enable it to come into stillness and quietude. Do not let fear or ambivalence dominate you this day. You are practicing your freedom and exercising it, for you can only be free when you are still inside, and if you are still inside, you are free already.</p><p>在每个小时，记住这个想法，当你参与世界事务时要记住它。在你更深入的冥想实践中，当你参与内心的生命时要记住它。在这两个领域中，内识必须占据主导地位。在这两个领域中，你的自由必须被行使才能被意识到。在你更深入的冥想中，运用你心灵的力量，使它进入静止与和平。不要让恐惧或矛盾左右你的一天。你正在实践你的自由，并在行使它，因为只有当你内心静止时，你才能自由，而如果你内心已经静止，你就已经在自由之中。</p><p>Practice 279: Two 30-minute practice periods. Hourly practice. </p><p>练习 279 ：两次 30 分钟的练习时段，每小时练习。</p>]]></content>

      <title>第二百七十八阶：不变的真理通过我表达它自身</title>
      <link href="/2024/12/29/278/"/>
      <url>/2024/12/29/278/</url>
      
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="STEP-278-WHAT-IS-CHANGELESS-WILL-EXPRESS-ITSELF-THROUGH-ME"><a href="#STEP-278-WHAT-IS-CHANGELESS-WILL-EXPRESS-ITSELF-THROUGH-ME" class="headerlink" title="STEP 278 WHAT IS CHANGELESS WILL EXPRESS ITSELF THROUGH ME."></a>STEP 278 WHAT IS CHANGELESS WILL EXPRESS ITSELF THROUGH ME.</h2><p>Truth is changeless, but it expresses itself within the world of changing circumstances and changing understanding. Thus, it appears that truth is changeable, yet the source of truth is not changeable. You who live in a world of change and are undergoing change yourself must realize that your Source is unchangeable. Realizing this you will have a foundation for trust in your Source. Trust can only be truly established when it is based upon that which cannot be changed, assaulted or destroyed. In this, your faith and trust will have a true foundation. You realize that what is changeless, which is the source of your trust and the recipient of your trust, will express itself in the changing world in changing ways. Thus, its expression will meet your every need. It will serve you in every circumstance. It will function on every level of understanding. It will actualize itself in every place of human endeavor. Thus, it will appear that the truth is changeable, for it operates in different ways in different environments, and it is recognized in different ways from different points of view. Yet truth itself, which is Knowledge itself, is ever changeless, ever loving and ever genuine. </p><p>真理是不变的，但它在不断变化的环境和不断变化的理解中表达它自己。因此，真理似乎是可以改变的，然而真理的源泉却是不可改变的。生活在变化的世界中，你自己也在经历着变化，必须认识到你的源泉是不会改变的。认识到这一点，你就有了信任源泉的基础。只有建立在无法改变、无法被攻击或摧毁的基础之上，信任才能真正建立起来。这样，你的信仰和信任就有了真正的基础。你会意识到，作为你的信任之源和信任的接受者的不变真理，会在不断变化的世界中以不断变化的方式表达它自己。因此，它的表达将满足你的一切需求。它将在各种情况下为你服务。它将在每一个理解层面运作。它将在人类事业的每一个地方实现它自己。因此，真理似乎是可以改变的，因为它在不同的环境中以不同的方式运作，从不同的角度以不同的方式被认识。然而，真理本身，也就是内识本身，是永远不变的、永远充满爱的、永远真实。</p><p>Therefore, today understand how relative and changeable your ideas are and how much you identify with that which is changeable, that which cannot stand upon its own. As your identity becomes founded in Knowledge and not merely on ideas, speculation or beliefs, you will begin to experience the permanence and security that only Knowledge can bestow. As you realize that your true life is changeless, then you will feel free to allow it to express itself in changing circumstances. Here you will escape all fear of death and destruction. Here you will find peace in the world, for the world is changing, but you are not.</p><p>因此，今天你要理解你自己的想法是多么相对和可变，以及你在多大程度上认同那些无法独立存在的事物。当你的身份建立在内识之上，而不仅仅是基于想法、猜测或信仰时，你将开始体验到只有内识才能赋予的永久性和安全感。当你意识到你真实的生命是不变时，你将感到自由，允许它在变化的环境中自由表达它自己。在这里，你将摆脱对死亡和毁灭的恐惧。在这里，你将在这个世界中找到和平，因为世界正在改变，而你并没有改变。</p><p>Practice 278: Read the lesson three times today.</p><p>练习 278 ：阅读今天的课程三遍</p>]]></content>

      <title>第二百七十七阶：我的想法是渺小的，但内识是伟大的。</title>
      <link href="/2024/12/29/277/"/>
      <url>/2024/12/29/277/</url>
      
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="STEP-277-MY-IDEAS-ARE-SMALL-BUT-KNOWLEDGE-IS-GREAT"><a href="#STEP-277-MY-IDEAS-ARE-SMALL-BUT-KNOWLEDGE-IS-GREAT" class="headerlink" title="STEP 277 MY IDEAS ARE SMALL, BUT KNOWLEDGE IS GREAT."></a>STEP 277 MY IDEAS ARE SMALL, BUT KNOWLEDGE IS GREAT.</h2><p>Realizing the truth of this statement will allow you to align yourself with the source of all Knowledge. Then you can escape the darkness of the world of imagination. Imagination is unstable, and even its brightest moments can turn to darkness in a second. Even its greatest inspirations can be bitterly discouraged with the slightest provocation. Here there is no certainty. Here there is no reality. Here nothing is trustworthy, for only change can be expected. That which is gifted and valued will most certainly be lost. That which is grim and destructive will most certainly pursue you.</p><p>意识到这一点的真理将使你与你内在内识的源泉保持一致。这样，你就可以摆脱想象的黑暗世界。想象是不稳定的，即使是它最光辉的时刻，也可能在一瞬间转为黑暗。即使是最伟大的启发，也可能因最微小的挑衅而受到严重打击。在这里，没有确定性；在这里，没有现实；在这里，没有什么是值得信赖的，因为唯一可以预期的就是变化。那些被赠予并珍视的事物，注定会丧失；那些阴沉且具有破坏性的事物，注定会追逐你。</p><p>Such is a life lived in imagination. Such is a life lived in the isolation of your own thinking. Do not underestimate the power of Knowledge to liberate you from this hopeless situation where nothing genuine can be discerned, where no true meaning can be acquired and where nothing that is permanent and real can be realized and established. It is your salvation out of the darkness of your separate imagination that will lead you into the reality of life and will redeem you there. </p><p>这就是生活在想象中的生命。这就是生活在你自己思维的孤立中。不要低估内识的力量，它能将你从这种无望的境地中解救出来，在这里，什么都无法辨认，无法获得真实的意义，也无法实现并确立任何持久和真实的事物。它是你从孤立想象的黑暗中走向生命的现实救赎，并且在这里拯救你。</p><p>Realize here that even your greatest ideas, even those ideas born of Knowledge, are small in contrast to Knowledge itself. Knowledge is the great source of your Being as it is expressing itself in your individual life. Therefore, honor what is great and realize what is small. Realize that in time as Knowledge begins to emerge within you and as you allow it to express itself ever more freely, you will begin to recognize those thoughts that emanate from Knowledge and those thoughts that are merely imagined. Yet even thoughts from Knowledge, which are far more powerful and effective than any other thought that you can imagine, even these thoughts which are the seeds of true understanding in the world are small in contrast to Knowledge.</p><p>在这里要意识到，甚至你最伟大的想法，甚至那些源于内识的想法，与内识本身相比也都是渺小的。内识是你存在的伟大源泉，它通过你的个体生命表达它自己。因此，要尊重伟大的内识，并认识到微小的事物。要意识到，随着内识开始在你内心浮现，并且允许内识更加自由地表达它自己，你将开始辨认出那些源自内识的思想和那些仅仅是想象的思想。然而，即使是来自内识的思想，也远比你所能想象的任何其他思想更强大、更有效，即使这些思想是世界上真实理解的种子——与内识相比依然是渺小的。</p><p>Remember upon the hour the power of this idea, for it is given to liberate you from your own confusion and false assumptions. In your deeper practice periods today, apply your mind actively. Attempt to look at every idea that you hold dear, whether it be positive or negative. Look at any idea that you believe in or adhere to. Examine your relationship to the primary ideas that govern your life. Then remind yourself after you look at each one that Knowledge is far greater than that idea. Here you will realize that there is a means for you to escape the world of ideas and enter the world of relationship, where everything is viable, real and based upon a foundation that can never change.</p><p>记住这个想法的力量，因为它是为了将你从困惑和错误的假设中解放出来。在你今天的深入练习期间，积极运用你的心灵。尝试去审视你珍视的每一个想法，不论是正面的还是负面的。审视任何你相信或坚持的想法。检查那些主导你生命的主要想法。然后，在你审视每个想法之后，提醒你自己内识远远超越这些想法。在这里，你会意识到，有一种方式让你脱离想法的世界，进入关系的世界，在那里，一切都是可行的、真实的，并且建立在一个永远不会改变的基础上。</p><p>Practice 277: Two 30-minute practice periods.

It leads you into the brightness and the clarity of reality. It guides your action and your thinking so that both may be effective and lead to true self-realization. Thus, God has given you the greatest possible gift: the means within yourself to correct all error, to resolve all confusion and conflict and to set your life on a true course that is aimed at your true destiny. Here you become empowered and honored and your self-worth is reclaimed. It is your value that must be reclaimed to you. God does not require that God’s value be reclaimed, for it has never been lost. But your value to yourself has been lost, and this can only be reclaimed by following a Greater Plan not of your own making, but which has been created for your total welfare. </p><p>内识是你的拯救，因为它能带你走出无望的困境，这种困境源于你试图生活在幻想和想象之中。它引领你进入光明和清晰的现实。它指导你的行动和思维，使两者都能有效地实现真实的自我认知。因此，上帝赐予了你最伟大的礼物：在你的内心深处纠正所有的错误，解决所有的困惑和冲突，让你的生命走上真实的轨道，以你的真实天命为目标。在这里，你变得有力量、有尊严，你的自我价值得到了重塑。你的价值必须被重新找回。上帝并不要求找回上帝的价值，因为它从未失去过。但是，你对你自己的价值已经丧失，只有遵循一个不是你自己制定的、而是为了你的整体福祉而制定的更伟大的计划，才能重新找回你的价值。</p><p>When you realize how much of your life has been wasted in ambivalence and how few results that has produced, then you will recognize the great need for Knowledge. This will give you the strength and the conviction to proceed in your preparation with the greatest possible self-involvement. Once you recognize your true need, then you will be able to recognize the true remedy that has been provided. </p><p>当你意识到你的生命有多少时间是在矛盾中浪费掉的，又有多少结果是在矛盾中产生的，你就会认识到对内识的伟大需求。这将给你力量和信念，让你以最大可能的自我投入进行准备。一旦你认识到你的真实需求，你就能认识到所提供的真实补救方法。</p><p>Thus, you as a student of Knowledge will realize with clarity of mind and simplicity of truth exactly what is necessary, for Knowledge is your salvation. Remember this upon the hour and think of it in light of your recent practices. In your deeper meditations, allow yourself to enter stillness completely, recognizing that you are engaging yourself with the means for your own salvation and through you the salvation of the world.</p><p>因此，作为内识的学生，你将以清晰的心灵和简单性的真理认识到内识是必要的，因为内识就是你的拯救。每时每刻都要记住这一点，并结合你最近的实践来思考。在更深层次的冥想中，让你自己完全进入静止状态，认识到你自己正在参与拯救你自己的方法，并通过你拯救世界。</p><p>Practice 276: Two 30-minute practice periods. Hourly practice.</p><p>练习 276： 两次 30 分钟的练习时段。每小时练习。</p>]]></content>

In essence, you either know what you are doing or you do not. If you do not know what you are doing, you simply wait for Knowledge. If you know what you are doing, you simply follow what you know. It is that simple. Unnecessary speculation, the attempt to make premature decisions based upon fear or preference, the requirement that you have the certainty that you lack and the projection of blame upon yourself and others for the failures of your weak decision making are what have taxed your mind, your body and your world. It is this you wish to escape today so that you may find the freedom in the certainty that God has given you. It is this certainty you must discover and follow. By following this you will reap all of its rewards and will become a contributor of these rewards in the world. </p><p>从不确定性中寻求自由，意味着你在寻求真正的、真实的、真正配得上自由之名的自由。从本质上讲，你要么知道你在做什么，要么不知道。如果你不知道你在做什么，你就只能等待内识。如果你知道你在做什么，你只需遵循你所知道的内识。就是这么简单。无谓的猜测，试图基于恐惧或偏好做出不成熟的决定，要求你自己拥有所缺乏的确定性，以及将你和他人的失败归咎于你自己的决策失误，这些都让你的身心和世界疲于奔命。今天，你希望摆脱这些，以便在上帝赐予你的确定性中找到自由。你必须发现并遵循这种确定性。遵循它，你将收获所有的回报，并成为世界上这些回报的贡献者。</p><p>Upon the hour remember today’s idea and see its complete relevancy to the world about you. In your deeper practice periods, give yourself to stillness. Give yourself to this encounter with Knowledge. Give yourself completely and let neither ambivalence nor uncertainty hold you back. In this, you will exercise the strength of Knowledge by following Knowledge, and in time you will become as strong as Knowledge truly is. Therefore, today seek to escape uncertainty and all that accompanies it. For this has destroyed the inspiration of humankind and has led humankind to war upon itself and the world.</p><p>每到一小时，记住今天的想法，并看到它与你周围的世界完全相关。在深入练习时，给予你自己静止。把你自己交给与内识的相遇。全身心地投入，不要让矛盾或不确定阻碍你。在此过程中，你将通过追随内识来锻炼内识的力量，久而久之，你将变得和内识一样强大。因此，今天要努力摆脱不确定性以及与之相伴的一切。因为它摧毁了人类的灵感，导致人类与它自己和世界开战。</p><p>Practice 275: Two 30-minute practice periods. Hourly practice. </p><p>练习 275： 两次 30 分钟的练习时段。每小时练习。</p>]]></content>

      <title>第二百七十四阶：今天，我从矛盾中寻求自由。</title>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="STEP-274-I-SEEK-FREEDOM-FROM-AMBIVALENCE-TODAY"><a href="#STEP-274-I-SEEK-FREEDOM-FROM-AMBIVALENCE-TODAY" class="headerlink" title="STEP 274 I SEEK FREEDOM FROM AMBIVALENCE TODAY."></a>STEP 274 I SEEK FREEDOM FROM AMBIVALENCE TODAY.</h2><p>Seek freedom from ambivalence, for this is the source of all human confusion, misery and frustration. Ambivalence is the indecision about participating with life. It is the indecision about being in life. It is the indecision about being alive. From this indecision all manner of self-imposition, all manner of attack and all manner of confrontation are created. It is from this indecision that people live in fantasy without Knowledge. </p><p>从矛盾中寻求自由，因为这是人类所有困惑、痛苦和挫折的根源。矛盾是对参与生命的犹豫不决。它是对生命的犹豫不决。它是对活着的犹豫不决。从这种优柔寡断中产生了各种自我强加、各种攻击和各种对抗。正是由于这种优柔寡断，人们生活在没有内识的幻想中。</p><p>Beware of ambivalence then. It is a sign that you are functioning without Knowledge and that you are trying to make your decisions based purely upon speculation, personal preference and fear. It is decision making without foundation that leads humanity astray. It is decision making without foundation that has led you astray. Knowledge dispels ambivalence, for it sets a clear direction. It is unconcerned with choices and with deliberation, for it simply knows what is correct and leads you towards your fulfillment, step by step, with certainty and abiding conviction.</p><p>察觉矛盾。这表明你是在没有内识的情况下运作的，你试图纯粹根据猜测、个人喜好和恐惧来做出决定。正是没有基础的决策将人类引入歧途。正是没有基础的决策将你引入歧途。内识能消除矛盾，因为它能确定明确的方向。它不关心选择和深思熟虑，因为它只知道什么是正确的，并以确定和持久的信念引领你一步步走向成功。</p><p>Remember upon the hour that you wish to escape from ambivalence. Realize as you repeat your lesson how much of your life is wasted in trying to decide between this and that, in asking yourself, “What should I do now,” in querying yourself about what is right and what is wrong and in wondering and worrying about the best choice and its possible consequences. Knowledge liberates you from this taxing and wasteful application of your mind. Knowledge does not deliberate. It simply waits for the time to act and then it acts. It is absolutely certain in its direction. It is unshakable in its conviction. If you follow this, which is God’s greatest gift to you who live in the world of ambivalence and confusion, you will find that you will have purpose, meaning and direction and that day after day they will be very available to you.</p><p>在你希望摆脱矛盾的时刻，请记住这一点。当你重复你的课程时，你会意识到，你生命中有多少时间是浪费在试图在这个和那个之间做出决定，浪费在问你自己“我现在应该做什么”，浪费在质疑你自己什么是对什么是错，浪费在怀疑和担心最佳选择及其可能的后果。内识将你从这种耗费心力的浪费中解放出来。内识不会深思熟虑。它只是等待时机，然后行动。它的方向是绝对确定的。它的信念不可动摇。如果你遵循这一点——这是上帝赐予生活在矛盾和困惑世界中的你最伟大的礼物——你会发现，你将拥有目的、意义和方向，而且日复一日，这些都将为你所用。</p><p>In your deeper meditations attempt to give yourself wholeheartedly to your practice. Do not be ambivalent about your practice. Do not hold back out of fear or uncertainty, for you are participating in this preparation because Knowledge has called you to do so, and every day you give yourself because Knowledge calls you to do so. Thus, as We proceed through Our preparation together, your Knowledge is strengthened day by day, for it is the basis of your participation here. What other reason could you possibly have for becoming a student of Knowledge?</p><p>在深入冥想时，尝试全心全意地投入到练习中。不要对你的实践模棱两可。不要因为恐惧或不确定而退缩，因为你参与这项准备工作，是因为内识召唤你这样做，而你每天给予你自己，也是因为内识召唤你这样做。因此，在我们一起进行准备的过程中，你的内识会一天天得到加强，因为它是你在这里参与的基础。你还有什么其他理由成为一名内识的学生呢？</p><p>Therefore, in your deeper practices and in your hourly remembrances, strengthen your conviction that you must escape from ambivalence. Realize the deadly cost of ambivalence. See how it keeps people lost in their ideas, denying their engagement with life. See the human cost around you. It is tremendous. Realize that with certainty everyone will find their rightful place. The world will proceed without the friction that it now must bear. In this way, all things seek fulfillment together in inclusion in life. That is The Way of Knowledge.</p><p>因此，在你的深入实践和每时每刻的回忆中，要坚定你必须摆脱矛盾的信念。认识到矛盾的致命代价。看看它是如何让人们迷失在他们的想法中，拒绝与生命接触。看看你周围人类付出的代价。这是巨大的。认识到只要有确定性，每个人都会找到他们应有的位置。世界将不再像现在这样摩擦不断。这样，万物将在融入生命中共同寻求满足。这就是内识之路。</p><p>Practice 274: Two 30-minute practice periods.

They hold the memory  of your origin and your destiny for you, which you must learn to realize through your experience in the world. They have traveled the ways of the world. They know of its opportunities and its difficulties. They know of the possible errors that you can commit, and they are aware of the errors you have committed already. They are fully prepared to guide you. They have the Wisdom and the accomplishment to do so. </p><p>你的老师代表着超越这个世界的精神家庭。他们为你持有你的起源和你天命的记忆，你必须通过你在这个世界中的经历来学习这一点。他们已经走过了世界的道路，知道它的机会和困难。他们知道你可能犯下的错误，也察觉到你已经犯下的错误。他们完全准备好指导你，他们拥有这样的智慧和成就。</p><p>Therefore, do not underestimate their value to you and always remember that they are present in your life to initiate you into Knowledge. They wish for you to become strong in Knowledge, eventually as strong as they have become. Thus, they serve your greatest need and purpose, and you must follow them, receive them and honor their presence, as a student honors a teacher. This will allow you to receive their gifts completely and will free you from any false associations you may make with them. This is a very responsible relationship, and you will mature within it. </p><p>因此，不要低估他们对你来说的价值，始终记得他们在你生命中是为了引导你进入内识。他们希望你在内识中变得强大，最终变得像他们一样强大。因此，他们服务于你最伟大的需求和目的，你必须跟随他们，接纳他们，并尊重他们的存在，就像学生尊敬老师一样。这将使你能够完全接收他们的礼物，并使你从对他们的错误联想中解脱出来。这是一段非常负责任的关系，你将在其中成熟。</p><p>Accept, then, the presence of your Teachers. Accept it upon the hour as you remind yourself that they are with you, and accept it in your two deeper meditation practices as you open yourself to receive them. This is a great opportunity for Knowledge. Your Teachers will initiate you into Knowledge, for they can only be known. Your images or concepts regarding them are relatively meaningless, except in that they might limit your approach. You must experience your Teachers’ essence, which is their presence, to fully know them. And you will find out from this experience, as it develops, that this is how you can experience life as a whole. </p><p>因此，接受你老师的存在。每小时提醒你自己他们与你同在，在你两次深入的冥想练习中接受他们的存在，打开你自己以接收他们。这是一个伟大的内识机会。你的老师将引导你进入内识，因为他们只能通过体验来被知晓。你对他们的形象或概念是相对无意义的，除非它们限制了你的接近方式。你必须体验你老师的本质，也就是他们的存在，才能完全知道他们。从这个逐渐发展的经历中，你将发现这也是你如何体验整体生命的方式。</p><p>Though your senses will perceive the form of things, your heart will experience the essence of things, and this is how things will become known. Once they are known, you will realize how you are to participate with them. Thus, all your faculties of mind will be utilized for one great purpose, for Knowledge will utilize all your faculties and the faculties of the world for the redemption of the world, which is the redemption of Knowledge within the world.</p><p>尽管你的感官会感知到事物的形式，但你的心将体验到事物的本质，这就是事物如何被知道的方式。一旦它们被知道，你将意识到你该如何与之共同参与。因此，你所有的心灵能力都将被用来服务于一个伟大的目的，因为内识将善用你的所有能力和世界的能力来救赎世界，这就是内识在世界中的救赎。</p><p>Practice 273: Two 30-minute practice periods.

You will be engaged in a life that you have not yet comprehended. You will be accessing power and resources that you have not yet fully recognized. You will be venturing deeper into life, beyond human assumptions, beyond human beliefs and beyond human conventions. This will require very strong guidance for you, both from Knowledge and from your primary relationships. Your Inner Teachers represent your most primary relationships, for these relationships are completely based upon Knowledge, and they are given to you to cultivate Knowledge safely and completely.</p><p>在通往内识的道路上，你需要老师的指导，因为你的冒险将远远超出你自己的概念和假设。你将参与你尚未理解的生命。你将获得尚未充分认识到的力量和资源。你将深入生命，超越人类的假设，超越人类的信仰，超越人类的传统。这将需要内识和你的主要关系为你提供强有力的指导。你的内在老师代表了你最主要的关系，因为这些关系完全建立在内识的基础上，他们给予你的是安全、完整地培养内识。</p><p>Therefore, accept your limitations as a student of Knowledge so that you may proceed with the assistance that will be required. Be grateful that such great assistance can be given to you and that it can permeate any circumstance because it is invisible to your eyes. Be grateful that you can experience it in any circumstance and that you can receive the counsel of your Teachers at those junctures in life where it is called for.</p><p>因此，接受你作为内识学生的局限性，这样你才能获得所需的帮助。感谢你能得到如此伟大的援助，感谢它能渗透到任何环境中，因为它是你看不见的。感谢你能在任何情况下体验到它，感谢你能在生命的关键时刻接受老师的建议。</p><p>Affirm the presence of your Teachers today so that you may have great courage and enthusiasm in your support of the emergence of Knowledge. Upon the hour remind yourself that your Teachers are with you. In your two deeper practice periods, enter into stillness and silence with them so that they may render their presence and their counsel to you if needed. Accept your studenthood so that you may learn to give to the world.</p><p>确认你的老师今天就在你身边，这样你就能以极大的勇气和热情支持内识的萌发。时刻提醒你自己，你的老师与你同在。在你的两次深入练习中，与他们一起进入静止和静默，以便他们可以在需要的时候向你提供他们的存在和建议。接受你的学生身份，这样你才能学会给予世界。</p><p>Practice 272: Two 30-minute practice periods.

Accept this, cultivate it, cherish it and welcome it. It is what will make you strong. It is what will make you devoted. It is what will bring to you the relationships you have always desired. This is the empowerment you so desperately need which you are learning now to claim for yourself. With this empowerment come the conditions for empowerment—that you respond to Knowledge and follow Knowledge, that you refrain from all motivations that are not born of Knowledge, that you become objective with yourself and your motives, that you question yourself without doubting yourself and that you surround yourself with individuals who can support the emergence of Knowledge within you and are free to tell you their own perceptions. This is essential for your well-being and development. This will protect you from selferror, which as you become more powerful will have greater and greater impact upon you and others. </p><p>接受责任，既你的回应能力。接受它，培养它，珍惜它，并欢迎它。它能让你变得强大。它能让你全心投入。它将为你带来你一直渴望的关系。这是你迫切需要的力量，而你现在正在学习如何为你自己获取这份力量。伴随这种赋权而来的，是赋权的条件——你要回应内识并跟随内识，你要克制所有并非源于内识的动机，你要对你自己保持客观，也要对你自己的动机保持客观，你要质疑你自己但不怀疑你自己，并且你要让你自己周围环绕着能够支持你内在内识显现的人，他们能够自由地告诉你他们自己的感知。这对你的幸福与发展至关重要。这将保护你免于自我错误的侵害，因为随着你变得更有力量，错误对你自己和他人的影响也会愈发巨大。</p><p>Accept responsibility today. Accept this, for it represents your truest and greatest need. Responsibility will enable you to love and extend yourself into the world. </p><p>今天接受责任。接受内识，因为它代表了你最真实和最伟大的需求。责任将使你能够去爱并将你自己延展到世界中去。</p><p>Upon the hour think of today’s idea. And as you enter meditation twice today, take full responsibility for being a student of Knowledge and enter into stillness and silence with your complete being. Let no thought or doubt dissuade you. Do not let ambivalence hold you back. Press onward. Open yourself. Enter the mystery of your life so that you may be able to respond to it, for this is the meaning of responsibility.</p><p>每小时思考今天的想法。当你进入两次冥想练习时，全然承担起成为内识学生的责任，以你的全部存在进入静止与静默。不要让任何思绪或疑惑劝阻你。不要让矛盾阻碍你。继续前行，打开你自己，进入你生命的神秘，以便你能够回应它，因为这就是责任的意义。</p><p>Practice 271: Two 30-minute practice periods. Hourly practice. </p><p>练习 271 ：两次 30 分钟的练习时段。每小时练习。</p>]]></content>

      <title>第二百七十阶：伴随力量而来的是责任</title>
      <link href="/2024/12/22/270/"/>

Knowledge will empower you, and you must be responsible to Knowledge. That is why you must become a follower. By becoming a follower you become a leader, for you are able to receive and you are able to be guided. Thus, you will teach others to receive and provide guidance for them. This is a natural extension of the gift that you are now receiving, which in time will find expression through you in your life. </p><p>伴随力量而来的是责任。内识会赋予你力量，但你必须对内识负责。这就是为什么你必须成为一个追随者。通过成为追随者，你会成为一名领导者，因为你能够接收并被指导。这样，你将教导他人如何接收并为他们提供指导。这是你正在接受的礼物的一种自然延伸，它最终会通过你，并在你的生命中得到表达。</p><p>It is very important that you recognize the relationship between power and responsibility. Responsibility requires selfdiscipline, self-restraint and self-control. It requires an objectivity about your own life which very few have yet attained in this world. Responsibility is a burden until it is recognized as a source of protection. It is the guarantee and the assurance that your gift will find a wholesome and welcome expression within you and that you will be advanced and accomplished by the rendering of your contribution. </p><p>认识力量与责任之间的关系非常重要。责任需要自律、自我约束和自我控制。它要求你对你自己的生命拥有一种客观性，而这是世界上很少有人达到的。责任是一种负担，直到它被认知为一种保护的来源。责任是对你的礼物能够在你内心找到健康而受欢迎的表达的一种保证和承诺，也是通过贡献使你能够成长和完成的保障。</p><p>It is very common in the world that people want power without responsibility, for their idea of freedom is that they are not beholden to anything. This is utterly counterproductive and has very dangerous consequences for those who persist in attempting it. You who are a student of Knowledge must learn to accept the responsibilities that are given to you, for they provide the protection and the guidance that you need so that you may develop appropriately, positively and completely. They are the assurance that your preparation will yield the great result that it is meant to yield.</p><p>在这个世界上，人们普遍希望拥有力量而无需承担责任，因为他们对自由的想法是不受任何事物的约束。这种想法完全适得其反，对那些坚持追求它的人有着非常危险的后果。作为内识的学生，你必须学会接受赋予你的责任，因为它们为你提供了你所需的保护和指导，以便你能够适当地、积极地和完整地发展。它们保证了你的准备工作将实现它所应实现的伟大结果。</p><p>Think of this idea upon the hour and do not forget it today. In your deeper practices, think very carefully about what this statement means. Think of your ideas about power and recognize how much they need responsibility to a Greater Source in order to be utilized and expressed appropriately. These two practice periods will be times of mental activity and application. Think very carefully of all your ideas surrounding the lesson for today. It is quite essential that you examine your own thinking and beliefs, for you must understand your current mental make-up in order to realize its impact upon your outer life. Today’s lesson may seem sobering at first, but in time it will give you the confidence and the assurance that you will need to progress wholeheartedly.</p><p>每小时思考这个想法，今天不要忘记它。在你更深入的练习中，仔细思考这句话的意义。思考你对力量的想法，并认识到力量多么需要对更伟大源头的责任，以便被适当地善用和表达。这两次练习将是心理活动和应用的时间。非常仔细地思考围绕今天课程的所有想法。检查你自己的思维和信念是非常重要的，因为你必须理解你当前的思维结构，以意识到它对你外在生命的影响。今天的课程一开始可能会显得严肃，但随着时间的推移，它会给你所需的信心和保证，让你全心全意地前进。</p><p>Practice 270: Two 30-minute practice periods. Hourly practice. </p><p>练习 270 ：两次 30 分钟的练习时段。每小时练习。</p>]]></content>

At first this will be very subtle, but as you continue to develop and apply yourself, the power of Knowledge will become stronger and stronger. It will be a force of attraction for some. It will be a force of rejection for others who are unable to respond to it. It will influence all. That is why you must learn to be very discerning in relationships, for as you progress as a student of Knowledge, your influence over others will be greater. You must not use this influence for selfish purposes, or your activities will be destructive to you and to others. </p><p>内识的力量将从接收内识的你身上扩展它自身。起初，这种力量会非常微妙，但随着你不断发展和运用你自己，内识的力量将变得越来越强大。对于一些人来说，这将是一种吸引力。对于另一些无法回应它的人来说，它将是一种排斥力。它将影响一切。因此，你必须学会在关系中非常具备辨别力，因为随着你作为内识学生的进步，你对他人的影响力将变得更大。你绝不能为了自私的目的使用这种影响力，否则你的行为将对你自己和他人造成破坏。</p><p>Knowledge provides this restraint that We have spoken of, and you must exercise it on your own behalf. If you are ambitious with Knowledge, you will pose very great risks to yourself and to other people, for wisdom, compassion, restraint and self-control must accompany the development of Knowledge. If you attempt to use Knowledge for your own selfish gain or for what you think the world needs, you will lead yourself astray and Knowledge will not accompany you.</p><p>内识提供了我们所说的这种自我约束，你必须为你自己行使这种约束。如果你对内识怀有野心，你将对你自己和他人构成极大的风险，因为智慧、同情心、克制和自我控制必须伴随内识的发展。如果你试图将内识用于自私的个人利益，或者你认为世界需要的事物，你将把你自己引入歧途，内识将不再与你同行。</p><p>Accept the restraint and development that are called for now, for they will protect you and enable you to render your gifts with a minimum of discord and personal risk. They will guarantee the wholeness and worthiness of your contribution, for it will be untainted by selfish motives. Practice upon the hour and enter deeply into meditation twice today. Repeat your idea for the day and enter into stillness once again. Allow this to be a day where Knowledge is strengthened.</p><p>接受现在所要求的自我约束和发展，它们将保护你，并使你能够在最小的纷争和个人风险中展现你的礼物。它们将保证你贡献的完整性和价值，因为它将不受自私动机的污染。今天的每小时提醒你自己这个想法，今天进行两次深度冥想。重复今天的想法，再次进入静止。让今天成为内识得以加强的一天。</p><p>Practice 269: Two 30-minute practice periods. Hourly practice. </p><p>练习 269 ：两次 30 分钟的练习时段。每小时练习。</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="STEP-268-I-WILL-NOT-BE-DECEIVED-BY-COMPLEXITY-TODAY"><a href="#STEP-268-I-WILL-NOT-BE-DECEIVED-BY-COMPLEXITY-TODAY" class="headerlink" title="STEP 268 I WILL NOT BE DECEIVED BY COMPLEXITY TODAY."></a>STEP 268 I WILL NOT BE DECEIVED BY COMPLEXITY TODAY.</h2><p>Problems in the world become complex when there is a difficulty that requires correction and development, and that becomes mixed with everyone’s preferences, everyone’s desire to protect what they have and everyone’s competition with each other. Thus it is that problems in the world become complex, and no matter what you do to attempt to solve them, somebody is disenfranchised. Someone is upset. Someone loses. In your societies this is manifest. But this only represents people’s fears and ambitions in contrast to their Knowledge. In Knowledge, you are willing to relinquish anything that stands in the way of Knowledge. You are willing to relinquish anything that is harmful to you or to others. You are willing to disengage from any situation which no longer proves to be beneficial to you or to others. This is because Knowledge makes true honesty possible. This is a selfless form of involvement in the world, and thus it is beneficial to all. </p><p>世界上的问题变得复杂，是因为存在需要纠正和发展的困难，而这些困难又与每个人的喜好、每个人想要保护自己所拥有的东西以及每个人彼此之间的竞争相交织。因此，世界上的问题变得复杂，无论你做什么尝试去解决它们，总会有人被排除在外。总有人不满，总有人失败。在你们的社会中，这一点表现得尤为明显。但这仅仅是人们的恐惧和野心与他们的内识之间的对比。在内识中，你愿意放下任何阻碍内识的事物。你愿意放下任何对你自己或他人有害的事物。你愿意脱离任何不再对你或他人有益的环境。这是因为内识使得真实的诚实成为可能。这是一种无私的方式参与世界，因此它对所有人都是有益的。</p><p>Therefore, when you look at a problem in the world and it appears complex, it is very difficult at first to see simply what the problem is. But the solution is always very direct. It is people’s fear of this that disables them from recognizing the obvious. It is given you this day to realize that there is a direct solution to all problems that require a solution. Sometimes a solution is obvious all at once. Sometimes it must be approached in stages. But each step is very direct if you are following Knowledge. </p><p>因此，当你看到一个问题显得复杂时，最初很难直接看出问题是什么。但解决方案总是非常直接的。人们对这一点的恐惧使他们无法认识到显而易见的答案。今天给予你这个机会，让你意识到所有需要解决的问题都有一个直接的解决方法。有时，解决方案一下子就显现出来。有时，它必须分阶段进行。但如果你在跟随内识，每一步都是非常直接的。</p><p>To approach problems in this way you must approach them without fear or preference. You must follow Knowledge and not attempt to use Knowledge to solve things according to your own designs. You cannot use Knowledge in this way, but you can follow Knowledge, and in following Knowledge you will follow a path of resolution. This is a path that few people will be able to recognize at first, but it is a path that will prove utterly effective over time, for it will free everyone involved and provide a means of successful self-application for everyone involved. Thus, the man or woman of Knowledge in the world becomes a source of resolution and restitution in the world. And their presence and their activities will always influence every situation for good. </p><p>以这种方式接近问题，你必须没有恐惧或偏好。你必须跟随内识，而不是试图利用内识根据你自己的设计去解决问题。你不能以这种方式使用内识，但你可以跟随内识，在跟随内识的过程中，你会走上一条解决问题的道路。这是一条起初很少人能认出的小路，但它是一条随着时间推移会证明极其有效的道路，因为它会让每个参与其中的人都得到解脱，并为每个参与者提供成功的自我运用途径。因此，世界上的内识男女会成为世界中的解决方案和修复的源泉。他们的存在和活动将始终对每个情境产生积极影响。</p><p>Do not be deceived by the seeming complexity of the world’s problems, for with Knowledge all things are simply resolved. Knowledge is not deceived, and as you learn to be with Knowledge, you will not be deceived either.</p><p>不要被世界问题的表面复杂性所迷惑，因为在内识面前，所有事情都能简单解决。内识不会被迷惑，而当你学会与内识同在时，你也不会被迷惑。</p><p>Remind yourself of this idea upon the hour and in your two deeper meditation practices, enter once again the sanctuary of stillness within you. Become accustomed to stillness because Knowledge is still. Become accustomed to stillness because in stillness you affirm your goodness and your worth. A mind at peace is not a mind at war. A mind at peace is not deceived by the world.</p><p>在每个小时中提醒你自己这个想法，在你的两次深度冥想中，再次进入你内心的静止圣殿。习惯于静止，因为内识是静止的。习惯于静止，因为在静止中你确认你的善良和价值。一个内心和平的心灵不是一个处于战争中的心灵。一个内心和平的心灵不会被世界所迷惑。</p><p>Practice 268: Two 30-minute practice periods.

How will you find this answer? Will you find it by struggling with yourself? Will you find it by trying every possible resolution that you can think of? Will you find it by worrying about it and fretting over it? Will you find it by denying it and seeking pleasurable stimulation instead? Will you find it by sinking into depression and thinking that life is so hard for you that you cannot meet the demands of your own circumstances?</p><p>你个人面临的所有问题都有一个非常简单的答案。你将如何找到这个答案呢？你会通过与你自己斗争来找到答案吗？你会通过尝试你能想到的所有可能的解决办法来找到它吗？你会通过担心和焦虑来找到答案吗？你会通过否认它并寻求快乐的刺激来找到它吗？你会陷入抑郁，认为生命对你来说是如此艰难，以至于你无法满足你自己处境的要求，从而找到它吗？</p><p>There is a simple answer to the problems that you face today. It is to be found in Knowledge. Yet to find Knowledge you must become still and observant and learn to disengage from fear and anxiety. Much of your life will be involved in solving problems, and it is in learning how to do this effectively, responsibly and even enthusiastically that you will achieve what you have come here to achieve.</p><p>对于你今天所面临的问题，都有一个简单的答案。答案就在内识中。然而，要找到内识，你就必须静下心来，善于观察，学会摆脱恐惧和焦虑。你生命中的大部分时间都将用于解决问题，只有学会如何有效地、负责任地甚至充满热情地解决问题，你才能实现你来到这里所要实现的目的。</p><p>Remind yourself of this idea throughout the day and do not be deceived by the complexity of problems. Problems are only complex when you are trying to derive a benefit from resolving them or from avoiding them. When you have a preference that is governing your mind, you cannot see the obvious. As you learn now to look at each problem with Knowledge, you will see that the resolution is apparent. You will see that you could not recognize this before because you were afraid of the outcome in some way or you had anxiety that the resolution of the problem would leave you bereft and poor. You will have a different vision today.</p><p>整天都要提醒你自己记住这一点，不要被问题的复杂性所迷惑。只有当你试图从解决问题或避免问题中获益时，问题才是复杂的。当你的偏好支配着你的心灵时，你就无法看到显而易见的事情。当你学会用内识来看待每一个问题时，你就会看到问题的解决是显而易见的。你会看到，你以前之所以不能认识到这一点，是因为你害怕某种结果，或者你担心问题的解决会让你变得一无所有、穷困潦倒。今天，你将拥有不同的视角。</p><p>In your two deeper practice periods, abide with Knowledge. Do not attempt to answer your problems, but simply be still and receptive. Knowledge is aware of what things must be addressed and will cast its influence upon you so that you may respond to it and follow its direction. Without continual interference from you, the obvious will arise, and you will learn what to do step by step. Thus it is that you will realize there is a simple answer for all problems that face you. This will be an affirmation of Knowledge, and you will be happy that life is giving you these problems so that you may exercise your true abilities in response to them.</p><p>在两次深入的练习期间，与内识同在。不要试图回答你的问题，只需静静地接受。内识知道哪些事情必须解决，并会对你施加影响，这样你就能对它做出回应，并遵循它的指引。如果没有你的不断干扰，显而易见的事情就会出现，你也会一步步学会该怎么做。这样，你就会意识到，你所面临的所有问题都有一个简单的答案。这将是对内识的肯定，你也会为生命给予你的这些问题而感到高兴，这样你就可以发挥你真实的能力来应对这些问题。</p><p>Practice 267: Two 30-minute practice periods.

Carry on this Review with as much objectivity as you can, especially regarding the results in your life, many of which you still cannot assess objectively. </p><p>今天和以前一样，回顾过去两周的准备工作。通过今天这个长时间练习的机会，回顾过去两周中发生的一切，包括准备过程中的指导、练习中的体验以及你生命中的整体结果。尽可能客观地进行这次回顾，特别是关于你生命中的结果，其中许多结果你目前可能还无法客观地评估。</p><p>Many things will change as you progress in your studies. Some things will fall away from you; other things will begin to build. Worldly problems will press upon you that require your engagement and application. Other things that you thought were problems will become increasingly remote and unnecessary for you to concern yourself with. Thus, your outer life adjusts itself so that you can recognize where you are to apply yourself now. Then your inner life and outer life can reflect one another. This is very important. You are beginning to learn how to learn, and you are seeing the world change as a result. The quality of your experience will be transformed in time so that all things, both common and extraordinary, will be viewed from a different viewpoint than before. You can then learn to take advantage of all opportunities and thus learn to appreciate life, even in its disappointments.</p><p>随着学习的深入，许多事情都会发生改变。有些事情会离你远去，有些事情则会开始建立。世俗的问题会压迫着你，需要你投入和应用。另一些你认为是问题的事情会变得越来越遥远，你也没有必要去关心。因此，你的外在生命会进行自我调整，以便你能认识到你自己现在应该在哪里运用你自己。这样，你的内在生命和外在生命就能相互反映。这一点非常重要。你开始学会如何学习，你也因此看到了世界的改变。随着时间的推移，你所经历的一切都会发生质的变化，从而以不同于以往的视角来看待一切事物，无论是普通的还是非凡的。这样，你就能学会善用一切机会，从而学会欣赏生命，即使是在失望中。</p><p>Practice this in the Review today. Be very thorough in your investigation. Begin with the first lesson in the two-week period and follow it day by day. Recognize what happened in your life each day. Try to remember. Try to concentrate here. In this way, you will feel the movement of your own life. It is in recognizing this movement over a period of time and seeing how the stages of your life progress that you will realize that you are firmly on the road to Knowledge. You will then see that there will be less and less behind you to hold you back and that the future will open itself to accommodate you increasingly. This is the beneficence of life bowing before you who are becoming a student of Knowledge.</p><p>今天在回顾中进行练习。调查要非常彻底。从两周的第一课开始，一天一天地进行。认识每天在你生命中发生的事情。尽量记住。试着集中注意力。这样，你就会感受到你自己生命的运动。正是在一段时间内认识到这种运动，并看到你生命的各个阶段是如何进展的，你才会意识到你正坚定地走在通往内识的道路上。这样，你就会看到，在你身后阻碍你前进的事物会越来越少，而未来也会越来越多地向你敞开大门。这就是生命的恩惠，它向正在成为内识学生的你鞠躬致敬。</p><p>Practice 266: One long practice period.</p><p>练习 266 ：一段漫长的练习期</p>]]></content>

It will require you to be present with life. It will require you to be open and honest. It will require you to have faith and consistent selfapplication. It will require that you not be in conflict. It will require that you have great love and respect for yourself and a great appreciation for the world. It will require that you be able to experience your Spiritual Family and recognize your true place in the universe.</p><p>内识会要求你摆脱过去，并摆脱对未来的焦虑。它会要求你与生命同在，要求你开放而诚实。它会要求你拥有信仰，并持续地自我运用。它会要求你没有冲突。它会要求你对你自己怀有伟大的爱与尊重，并对世界抱有极大的感激之情。它会要求你能够体验到你的精神家庭，并认识到你在宇宙中的真实位置。</p><p>Knowledge requires this of you in order for you to fully extend yourself to accept it. In this way, you become free in learning to become free. You become guided by Knowledge by learning to become guided by Knowledge. Here you achieve the goal by taking the steps. There is no magic formula where all of a sudden you become free. There is no magic belief system which, once adopted, frees you from the restraints of your past and concerns over your future. You learn this true freedom by application, step by step. Thus, as you learn to reclaim Knowledge, Knowledge reclaims you. And as you learn what freedom is, you actually become free. </p><p>内识对你的要求是为了让你能够完全敞开心扉去接受它。通过这种方式，你在学习如何变得自由中获得自由。你通过学习如何被内识引导而被内识引导。在这里，你通过采取步骤来实现目标。没有什么魔法公式可以让你突然间变得自由。没有任何魔法般的信仰体系能够在你采用之后让你从过去的束缚和对未来的担忧中解脱出来。你通过应用，一步步地学习这种真实的自由。因此，当你学习重新获得内识时，内识也在重新获得你。当你学习自由是什么时，你实际上正在成为自由。</p><p>Your part is very small and Our part is very great. You need only follow the steps and utilize them. The steps that are given will guarantee the result. A greater freedom awaits you and as you approach it, you assume that freedom and benefit from all of the qualities of that freedom and demonstrate all aspects of that freedom. Such is the nature of a perfect Plan that is beyond human comprehension. So perfect is it that you cannot destroy it if you follow it faithfully. This restores you and returns to you self-trust, self-confidence, self-love and comprehension of yourself in the world.</p><p>你的部分是非常渺小的，而我们的部分是非常伟大的。你只需跟随这些步骤并运用它们。所给予的步骤会确保结果的实现。有一种更伟大的自由正在等待着你，当你接近它时，你会承担起这种自由，并从这种自由的所有品质中受益，并展现这种自由的所有方面。这就是人类无法理解的完美计划的自然。它是如此完美，以至于只要你忠实地跟随它，就无法破坏它。这会恢复你，并将自信、自爱以及对你自己在世界中的理解归还给你。</p><p>Think upon this idea every hour today, and in your deep meditation times enter into stillness and freedom. It is a great freedom to have this opportunity to immerse yourself in Knowledge, to immerse yourself in presence and to immerse yourself in the actual substance of true relationship in the universe. As you approach this, you will know that it is your freedom, and you will know that you are becoming free to assume it. Therefore, today you will take a great step towards realizing that a greater future is awaiting you. This great step will release you increasingly from the concern, the anxiety, the pain and the disappointment of your past. This will show you that a greater freedom is awaiting you.</p><p>今天每小时都要思考这个想法，在你深度冥想的时间里，进入静止与自由。拥有这个机会沉浸在内识中，沉浸在存在中，沉浸在宇宙真实关系的实质中，这是一种伟大的自由。当你接近这一点时，你会知道这是属于你的自由，你会知道你正在变得自由，去承担它。因此，今天你将迈出重要的一步，认识到更伟大的未来正在等待着你。这重要的一步会让你越来越从过去的忧虑、焦虑、痛苦和失望中解脱。这会向你展示有一种更伟大的自由正在等待着你。</p><p>Practice 265: Two 30-minute practice periods.

The step you take today will be very substantial in giving you a new viewpoint about freedom, about bondage, about problem solving and about the nature of true advancement. </p><p>今天，你将有机会进一步学习自由。你今天迈出的这一步，将为你带来关于自由、关于束缚、关于解决问题以及关于真实进步自然的新视角。</p><p>Today think about your lesson on the hour and think about what freedom is. In your longer practice periods, devote your mind to thinking about freedom. This is a very important focal point today. In your longer meditations in particular, devote your mind entirely to reviewing your ideas about freedom. What do you think constitutes freedom? What do you think prevents people from being free? What produces a freedom that is lasting and secure? How can this be achieved? What will support it in the future? After you spend approximately thirty minutes thinking about all this in each practice, enter into stillness and silence. Open yourself to allow Knowledge to speak to you. Abide with your Teachers there. After you have exhausted your ideas, enter into stillness and receptivity. </p><p>每小时思考今天的课程，并思考自由是什么。在较长的练习期间，将你的心灵专注于思考自由。这是今天一个非常重要的焦点。特别是在较长的冥想中，全心全意地审视你关于自由的想法。你认为什么构成了自由？你认为是什么阻碍了人们获得自由？什么能带来持久而安全的自由？如何实现这一点？未来需要什么来支持它？在每次练习中，用大约30分钟的时间思考所有这些问题，然后进入静止和静默的状态。允许你自己开放，允许内识对你讲话。与你的老师同在。当你用尽你的想法后，进入静止与接收的状态。</p><p>It is very important that you be aware of your own ideas about freedom because until these are recognized and adjusted, they will continue to cast their influence upon you. They will continue to dominate your thinking and thus your behavior. A greater freedom is now available to you, but you must learn how to approach it. Today you shall learn more about freedom—what you think freedom is and what freedom really is.</p><p>察觉你自己关于自由的想法是非常重要的，因为在这些想法被识别并调整之前，它们将继续对你施加影响，并继续主导你的思维和行为。现在一个更伟大的自由正向你敞开，但你必须学习如何接近它。今天你将更多地学习自由——你认为的自由是什么，以及自由真正的意义是什么。</p><p>Practice 264: Two 40-minute practice periods.

Why project further blame or judgment? Why make your life more complex and more frustrating when all things become clear with Knowledge? Why make your mind more complex? Why attribute more and more qualities to yourself? Why invent new levels of thinking and being when with Knowledge all things become clear? Why project more and more distinctions upon the world? Why make the world seem so hopelessly complex and meaningless when with Knowledge all things become clear? </p><p>为什么要进行额外的猜测？为什么要进一步指责或评判？既然有了内识，一切都会变得清晰，为什么还要让你的生命变得更复杂、更令人沮丧呢？为什么要让你的心灵更加复杂？为什么要赋予你自己越来越多的特质？既然有了内识，一切都变得清晰了，为什么还要发明新的思维和存在方式？为什么要对世界进行越来越多的区分？既然有了内识，万事万物都变得清晰明了，为什么还要让世界看起来如此复杂无望、毫无意义呢？</p><p>You have only to learn to be with Knowledge to see what Knowledge sees, to do what Knowledge does and to have the peace of Knowledge, the grace of Knowledge, the inclusion of Knowledge, the relationships of Knowledge and all that Knowledge contains, which the world cannot possibly duplicate. </p><p>你只需学会与内识同在，就能看到内识所看到的，做内识所做的，并拥有内识的和平、内识的优雅、内识的包容、内识的关系以及内识所包含的一切，而这些是世界无法复制的。</p><p>In your two deeper practices return to being with Knowledge, in humility and simplicity, in stillness and in silence.

Your thoughts about yourself are largely based upon your expectations and disappointments. It is very difficult to observe yourself from within your personal mind, for your personal mind is made up of your personal thoughts, which are not born of Knowledge. To view yourself with Knowledge, you must be in relationship with Knowledge. This will lead you to experience yourself in an entirely new way. This experience must be repeated and expressed over and over again, in many, many situations. Then you will begin to get a real sense and experience of who you are. This sense and experience will not be born of condemnation and unforgiveness, for only your idea of yourself can be disappointed. Life will disappoint you in this way, for life can only fulfill you according to your true nature and True Self. To realize this means you have realized the value and meaning of life and your inclusion in it. This requires discernment. This requires wisdom. This requires a step-by-step preparation. This requires patience and tolerance. This requires that you learn to use your experience for good not for ill. </p><p>如果你不知道你是谁，你只能评判你认为的你是谁。你对你自己的看法很大程度上基于你的期望和失望。从个人心灵中观察你自己是非常困难的，因为你的个人心灵是由个人的思想构成的，而这些思想并非源于内识。要以内识的视角看待你自己，你就必须与内识建立关系。这将引领你以全新的方式体验你自己。这种体验需要在许多不同的情境中一再重复并表达。这样，你才能逐渐获得对你自己真实的感知与体验。这种感知与体验不会源于谴责和不宽恕，因为只有你对你自己的想法才会感到失望。生命会以这种方式让你失望，因为生命只能按照你的真实自然和真实的自我来满足你。意识到这一点意味着你已经理解了生命的价值与意义以及你在其中的位置。这需要辨别力。这需要智慧。这需要一步步的准备。这需要耐心与包容。这需要你学会使用你的经历为善而非为恶。</p><p>Therefore, your condemnation of yourself is unfounded. It is based merely on assumptions. Remember this upon the hour and consider it in light of all the events this day, which will teach you the meaning of today’s lesson. In your two longer practice periods, once again engage your mind actively in attempting to comprehend the meaning of today’s lesson. </p><p>因此，你对你自己的谴责是毫无根据的。它仅仅基于假设。每小时记住这一点，并结合这一天中的所有事件来思考它的意义，这些事件将教导你今天课程的意义。在两次较长的练习中，再次积极地运用你的心灵，尝试理解今天课程的意义。</p><p>As you penetrate your own self-judgment, realize it is born of your fear and based upon assumption. If you realize you don’t know who you are and you are completely confused about this, then you will place yourself in a position to become a true student of Knowledge. You will put yourself in a position to learn all things rather than attempting to defend your assumptions. This represents your studenthood. Your function in life now is to be a student of Knowledge. Use your mind purposefully today. Use your mind objectively. Use your mind to realize what you do not know and all that you need to know. Use your mind to appreciate and to utilize the steps that are being given to you now for you to reclaim Knowledge in the world.</p><p>当你穿透你自己的自我判断时，要意识到它源于你的恐惧，并基于假设。如果你意识到你并不知道你是谁，并且对这一点完全感到困惑，你就会把你自己放置在成为真实内识学生的位置。你会让你自己处于学习一切事物的位置，而不是试图捍卫你的假设。这体现了你的学生身份。你当前生命中的职责就是成为内识的学生。今天有目的地使用你的心灵。客观地使用你的心灵。使用你的心灵去认识你不知道的和你需要知道的一切。使用你的心灵来欣赏并善用现在被给予你的步骤，以便你在这个世界上重新获得内识。</p><p>Practice 262: Two 30-minute practice periods. Hourly practice. </p><p>练习 262 ：两个 30 分钟的练习时段。每小时练习。</p>]]></content>

This is Knowledge guiding you. If you try to give for your own self-aggrandizement, if you try to give for your own self-assurance or if you try to give to alleviate an abiding sense of guilt or inadequacy, you will not give with discernment. Your giving, then, will be ill placed and will produce increasing conflict and discouragement for you. </p><p>如果你给予时没有个人的野心，你就会依据内识去给予，你的礼物将是具体的，并以这样的方式给予，它将增强你和那些能够接受你礼物的人的能力。这就是内识在引导你。如果你试图为你自己的自我膨胀而给予，如果你试图为你自己的自我肯定而给予，或者试图通过给予来减轻持续存在的内疚感或不足感，你就不会带着辨别力去给予。你的给予将会失去方向，并为你带来更多的冲突和沮丧。</p><p>Life does nothing aimlessly. Everything fulfills a purpose. Therefore, your giving must be done with discernment, and your discernment is something you must learn step by step, day by day. This is Wisdom functioning in the world. With Knowledge you must learn this Wisdom; otherwise, you will not be able to give your true gifts effectively and will misinterpret their results. Knowledge will give you that which must be given truly and will direct you to give truly. If you do not interfere with this or place an extra burden upon your giving, your giving will be totally effective and will acknowledge both the giver and the receiver. </p><p>生命中没有无目的的行为。一切都有其目的。因此，你的给予必须带着辨别力，而辨别力是你需要一步一步、一天一天地学习的。这就是智慧在世界上的运作。你必须用内识来学习这种智慧；否则，你将无法有效地给予你的真实礼物，并且会误解它们的结果。内识会给你必须真正给予的礼物，并引导你去真正的给予。如果你不干涉这一点，也不给你的给予增加额外的负担，你的给予将是完全有效的，并将同时肯定给予者和接收者。</p><p>Remember this upon the hour. Exercise discernment. There are people you should not give to in a direct way. There are people you should give to in a direct way. There are situations you should not enter. There are situations you must enter. There are problems you should not involve yourself with. There are problems you should involve yourself with. How can you personally discern where your gifts must be placed? Only Knowledge can discern this, and you can only discern it with Knowledge. Therefore, trust your deepest inclinations today. Do not let compulsions born of guilt or fear guide you or motivate you in your desire to give. Practice this day to learn discernment. Practice this day to align yourself with Knowledge. </p><p>每小时提醒你自己这一点。练习辨别力。有些人你不应直接给予。有些人你应直接给予。有些情境你不应进入。有些情境你必须进入。有些问题你不应介入。有些问题你必须介入。你如何能够仅凭个人的判断来分辨你的礼物应该给予何处？唯有内识能够分辨这一点，而你也只能通过内识来分辨。因此，今天信任你最深层次的倾向。不要让内疚或恐惧驱使你或引导你想要给予的愿望。今天的练习是学习辨别力。今天的练习是让你自己与内识保持一致。</p><p>In your longer practice periods engage yourself once again with attempting to comprehend today’s lesson. Do not be happy with false assumptions. Consider all thoughts and feelings in favor of or against today’s idea. Begin to observe your own ambitions. Begin to observe how they are born of your fears. Begin to discern how simple it is to follow Knowledge. With simplicity comes power. You must learn discernment. Learning this will take time. In this, you learn to utilize all experiences for good, for no experience should be condemned. It should always be used for learning and preparation. In this way, you will not justify error, but use it for your own development and for the advancement of the world.</p><p>在你较长的练习时间中，再次努力去理解今天的课程。不要满足于错误的假设。考虑所有支持或反对今天想法的思想和感受。开始观察你的野心，开始观察它们如何源于你的恐惧。开始辨别跟随内识的简单性。简单带来力量。你必须学习辨别力。学习这一点需要时间。在这个过程中，你要学会善用一切经历，因为任何经历都不应受到谴责。它应始终用于学习和准备。以这种方式，你就不会为错误辩护，而是使用它为你自己的发展和世界的进步进行服务。</p><p>Practice 261: Two 30-minute practice periods.

The world is in great need. It is demonstrating great confusion and error, and yet you have come to be a friend of the world because the world needs your friendship. In this, you receive a greater reward than anything you could secure for yourself alone, for anything you secure for yourself alone you must take from life. Yet anything you give and receive as a friend to the world, life gives to you, and it does not lose in the exchange. Then there is no guilt in your giving and in your receiving. Here your involvement is wholesome and clean. With Knowledge this becomes evident and is demonstrated day after day until you finally learn that it is true without exception.</p><p>今天做世界的朋友，因为你来这里是为了成为世界的朋友。世界处于伟大的需求之中，展现着极大的困惑与错误。然而，你的到来是为了成为世界的朋友，因为世界需要你的友谊。在这个过程中，你会获得比任何你单独为你自己争取的东西更大的回报，因为任何你为你自己争取的东西，你都必须从生命中夺取。而任何你作为世界的朋友给予和接受的东西，生命都会回赠给你，并且在这交换中毫无损失。这样，你的给予和接受中就没有负罪感。在这里，你的参与是完整且纯净的。随着内识的引导，这一点将日复一日变得清晰，并得到证明，直到你最终学会，这毫无例外地是真实的。</p><p>Upon the hour be a friend to the world. Recognize that all anger comes from confusion and that Knowledge is emerging now to resolve all confusion. As a result, your life is now engaged with true resolution and not with compounding the world’s predicament. Your life is about resolution and not predicament. Be a friend to the world. In your two deeper practice periods in stillness, give yourself to being a friend to the world, for this will ease the world’s confusion. As you learn to give this with wisdom and discernment, you will allow the world to become a friend to you, for the world wishes to become your friend as well.</p><p>每小时成为世界的朋友。认识到所有的愤怒都源于困惑，而内识正在显现，以解决所有的困惑。因此，你的生命现在参与的是对真实解决的追求，而不是在世界的困境中再添新难。你的生命关乎解决，而不是困境。做世界的朋友。在你两次深入的静止练习中，全身心地成为世界的朋友，因为这会减轻世界的混乱。当你以智慧和辨别力学习如何给予时，你将允许世界成为你的朋友，因为世界也希望成为你的朋友。</p><p>Practice 260: Two 30-minute practice periods.

Even if you do not carry this out in any formal sense with people, your life is a demonstration and, therefore, a form of teaching. </p><p>你来到这里是为了教导。从你抵达这里的那一刻起，你所做的一切都是在教导。你的思想和行为是教导的载体。即使是小时候，你也通过自己的行为教导他人，让爱你的人感到欣喜或沮丧。在你生命的每一个阶段，你都在教导，因为教导是生命表达的自然功能。因此，你天生具有教导的功能。即使你不以正式的方式对他人进行教导，你的生命本身就是一种展示，因此也是一种教导。</p><p>That is why as your life becomes allied with Knowledge and expressive of Knowledge, your life will become the teaching itself. Then in whatever avenue you are directed to choose for your self-expression, which will be genuine according to your nature, you will be able to express your teaching in gestures great and small, in words and without words and in accomplishments in every avenue and walk of life because you have come to the world to teach. The world can only teach you that you need to teach the truth. That is the world’s teaching to you. It teaches you of the great need for Knowledge, and it teaches you of the presence of Knowledge. Thus, the world serves and supports your true function, as you serve and support the true function of life.</p><p>正因如此，当你的生命与内识结合并表达内识时，你的生命将成为教导本身。无论你被引导选择何种表达方式，只要符合你的自然，你都能通过大大小小的行动、语言或无声的行为以及在生命各个领域的成就来表达你的教导，因为你来到这个世界就是为了教导。世界只能教导你一个事实：你需要教导真理。这是世界对你的教导。它教导你对内识的伟大需求，并教导你内识的存在。因此，世界支持并服务于你的真实运作，而你也支持并服务于生命的真实运作。</p><p>Remember this idea upon the hour. In your two deeper meditation practices give yourself to thinking of this very, very carefully. These are practices of mental engagement now. Think of the meaning of today’s idea. Realize that you have always been teaching through demonstration. Think of what you want to teach with your life and think of what you want to fortify with your life. Think of what you want to give and think of what the world has given to you to stimulate this true desire. All these things will generate right thinking and right action, and through right thinking and right action Knowledge will flow effortlessly through you to bless life around you and to bring purpose, meaning and direction to your relationships.</p><p>每小时记住这个想法。在你的两次更深层次的冥想练习中，让你自己非常、非常仔细地思考这个问题。这些都是心理实践的练习。思考今天这个想法的意义。意识到你一直在通过示范进行教导。思考你想用生命教导什么，思考你想用生命强化什么。思考你想要给予什么，思考这个世界给予了你什么来激发这种真实的渴望。所有这些都将产生正确的思维和正确的行动，通过正确的思维和正确的行动，内识将毫不费力地流淌在你的身上，祝福你周围的生命，并为你的关系带来目的、意义和方向。</p><p>Practice 259: Two 30-minute practice periods. Hourly practice. </p><p>练习 259： 两个 30 分钟的练习时段。每小时练习。</p>]]></content>

Your friends tomorrow will be all who will reclaim Knowledge. Therefore, everyone is either your friend or will become your friend. It is only a matter of time, and time can only seem long to those who dwell within it without purpose. But to those who dwell in time with purpose, time moves swiftly and brings about this great result. </p><p>你今天的朋友是所有正在重拾内识和已经重拾内识的人。明天，你的朋友将是所有重拾内识的人。因此，每个人要么是你的朋友，要么将成为你的朋友。它只是时间问题，而对于那些无目的地沉浸在时间中的人来说，时间似乎是漫长的。但对于那些带着目的在时间中生活的人而言，时间会迅速流逝，并带来这个伟大的结果。</p><p>Who are your friends today? Everyone is your friend or will become your friend. Therefore, why have an enemy? Why call another an enemy who is in opposition to you, for they will become your friend. Knowledge will join you. You are reclaiming Knowledge, so you are paving the way for this. </p><p>你今天的朋友是谁？每个人都是你的朋友，或将成为你的朋友。因此，为什么要有敌人呢？为什么要把与你对立的人称之为敌人，因为他们最终会成为你的朋友。内识将与你同行。你正在重新找回内识，因此，你正在为此铺平道路。</p><p>Who are your friends today? Your Teachers and your Spiritual Family and all who reclaim Knowledge. Thus, your range of friendship is enormous. There are many avenues in the reclamation of Knowledge, but the essence of learning is always to become engaged with Knowledge itself and to allow Knowledge to express itself through you. Thus, the universe is filled with your friends—some of whom you may recognize and some of whom you may not be able to recognize, some of whom you will be able to involve yourself with and some of whom you will not be able to involve yourself with, some of whom you will be able to accomplish things with and others whom you will not be able to accomplish things with. It is all a matter of time. </p><p>你今天的朋友是谁？你的老师、精神家庭以及所有重新找回内识的人。因此，你的友谊范围十分广泛。在重新找回内识的过程中有许多途径，但学习的本质始终是与内识本身建立联系，并允许内识通过你表达它自身。因此，宇宙中充满了你的朋友——有些你可能认识，有些你可能不认识；有些你能与之交往，有些你不能与之交往；有些你能与之共事，有些你不能与之共事。所有这一切都是时间的问题。</p><p>Repeat this idea upon the hour. Witness it as a signpost of reality for you. In your deeper practices, enter into stillness and silence so that you may experience the depth of your relationship with your true friends. Your life is filled with love. It is filled with the result of all those who are reclaiming Knowledge now. Your desire for Knowledge is motivated by all those who still refuse to reclaim Knowledge, for they in the future will be your friends as well. Given this viewpoint, you will recognize that even those who will be your friends in the future are in actuality your friends today, for they are serving you, and they are asking that you serve them through your accomplishment with Knowledge.</p><p>每小时重复这个想法。将其视为现实的标志。在更深入的练习中，进入静止和静默，以体验与你真实朋友之间关系的深度。你的生命充满了爱。它充满了所有现在正在找回内识的人的结果。你对内识的渴望是受到那些仍然拒绝重新找回内识的人的激励，因为他们将来也会成为你的朋友。从这个角度来看，你将认识到，即使那些未来将成为你朋友的人，实际上也是你今天的朋友，因为他们在服务于你，而他们请求你通过对内识的成就来服务于他们。</p><p>Practice 258: Two 30-minute practice periods.

Its greatness is born of the fact that you live in a Greater Community of worlds. Its greatness is born of the fact that Knowledge is the essential aspect of yourself which you carry within you. The greatness of life is affirmed with the presence of your Teachers and the presence of all who prepare to reclaim Knowledge with you. </p><p>生命比你曾经意识到的要还要伟大，当然也比你曾经想象的更为浩瀚。它的伟大源于你生活在一个世界的大社区之中。它的伟大源于这样一个事实，即内识是你自己不可或缺的层面，而内识就在你的内在。生命的伟大因你的老师和所有与你共同准备重新发现内识的人们的存在而得以确认。</p><p>Thus, you have a greater purpose in a greater universe. Thus, you can see your world in its proper context. Thus, you can see yourself in your proper context, for you will play a small part in the greater evolution of the world, and your part will be essential. It will be within your range and grasp to accomplish. Something small done for something great means that the smallest contribution bears the greatness of that which is served. This redeems you to yourself; this redeems you to life. This casts away all darkness and dispels all negative imagination, for you are serving a greater life. </p><p>因此，你在更大的宇宙中拥有一个更伟大的目的。因此，你能在恰当的背景下看待你的世界。这样，你就能在适当的环境中看到你自己，因为你将在世界更大的进化中扮演一个微小的角色，而你的角色将是至关重要的。这在你的能力范围之内，也在你可以实现的范围之内。为伟大的事业做出微小的贡献意味着，即使是最微小的贡献也蕴含着它所服务的伟大。这是对你自己的救赎，这是对你生命的救赎。这将驱散所有黑暗，消除一切消极的想象，因为你正在服务于更伟大的生命。</p><p>In your longer practices engage yourself in trying to comprehend the meaning of today’s idea. Use your mind meaningfully. Use it actively and objectively, for this is the purpose of your mind.</p><p>在较长时间的练习中，允许你自己尝试理解今天想法的意义。有意义地运用你的心灵。积极而客观地运用它，因为这就是你心灵的目的。</p><p>Practice 257: Two 30-minute practice periods. </p><p>练习 257 ： 两个 30 分钟的练习时段</p>]]></content>

It gives meaning and direction to your understanding of your participation and your contribution in the world. It is not meant to frighten you or to create uncertainty or anxiety because with Knowledge uncertainty and anxiety are not essential. With Knowledge there is no uncertainty, for the quietness of Knowledge is your certainty, the voice of Knowledge is your certainty and the movement of Knowledge is your certainty. All of your mental and physical abilities and faculties can serve to express this in whatever avenue you are destined to serve. </p><p>这是关于你们世界进化的真理声明。它为你理解你对世界的参与和贡献提供了意义和方向。这个声明并不是为了吓唬你，也不是为了制造不确定性或焦虑，因为对于内识而言，不确定性和焦虑并不是必要的。与内识同在不确定性就会消失，因为内识的宁静就是你的确定性，内识的声音就是你的确定性，内识的运动就是你的确定性。你所有的心理和生理都能在你注定要服务的任何领域中表达这一点。</p><p>The statement that the world is emerging into the Greater Community of worlds is an affirmation of your purpose because your perception, your understanding and your appreciation of the world must grow. Your understanding of the world’s difficulties and opportunities must grow. You cannot hold a small vision of the world and possibly understand the meaning of your own Knowledge. You must think in a larger context. You must not think only of yourself—your wants and your fears—because you are part of a greater life which you have come to serve. The world that you are serving now and will learn to serve in the future is emerging into the Greater Community of worlds.</p><p>世界正在融入大社区的世界，这个声明肯定了你的目的，因为你对世界的感知、理解和欣赏必须增长。你对世界的困难和机会的理解必须加深。你不能对世界抱有狭隘的看法，这样你就没有可能理解你自己内识的意义。你必须在更大的背景下思考。你不能只考虑你自己——你的愿望和你的恐惧——因为你是你所服务的更伟大生命的一部分。你现在所服务的世界，以及将来要学习服务的世界，正在融入大社区的世界。</p><p>Repeat this idea upon the hour and think of it as you view the world around you. In your deeper practices, engage your mind actively in attempting to understand today’s lesson. Today’s practice is not focused upon stillness but on comprehension. Here the mind is used meaningfully, for the mind should either be used meaningfully or not at all. Allow yourself to consider all of your ideas about today’s lesson. </p><p>每小时重复这个想法，并在观察周围世界时思考它。在你更深入的练习中，积极调动你的心灵，尝试理解今天的课程。今天的练习不再侧重于静止，而是理解。在这里，心灵被有意义地使用，因为心灵要么有意义地使用，要么根本不用。允许你自己回顾关于今天课程的所有想法。</p><p>Concern yourself with understanding your objections, your beliefs, your fears and your preferences. When these have been recognized, you will be in a position to know. Knowledge will be stimulated by today’s lesson, for today’s lesson is to stimulate Knowledge.</p><p>关注你自己，理解你的反对意见、信念、恐惧和喜好。当你认识到这些之后，你将处于知道的位置。今天的课程将激发内识，因为今天的课程就是为了激发内识。</p><p>Practice 256: Two 30-minute practice periods.

Remember that when individuals are without Knowledge, they can only commit error and express their confusion. They can only practice confusion, and they can only serve confusion. This, then, will teach you to value what is valuable and to recognize what is meaningless. This will teach you that you are always in service to that which you value; you are always fortifying that which you value; you are always practicing that which you value. </p><p>不要让困惑阻止你，因为所有的错误都源于困惑。记住，当个人没有内识时，他们只能犯错，只能表达他们的困惑。他们只能实践困惑，他们只能服务于困惑。这将教会你去珍视有价值的内识，并识别没有意义的事物。这将教会你始终在为你所珍视的内识服务；你始终在巩固你所珍视的内识；你始终在实践你所珍视的内识。</p><p>Now you are learning to value Knowledge. You are learning to practice Knowledge. You are learning to recognize Knowledge. And you are learning to serve Knowledge. This is the demonstration that you require. Do not let the confusion of the world dissuade you, for it reminds you of your great need. How can the errors of the world dissuade you when they should encourage you? Correctly seen, they will only prompt you to give yourself more fully to your preparation now. This preparation in which you are engaged holds the promise of activating Knowledge in you. You need only follow its steps. </p><p>现在你正在学习珍视内识。你正在学习实践内识。你正在学习认识内识。你正在学习服务于内识。这是你所需要的证明。不要让世界的困惑阻止你，因为它提醒了你自己伟大的需求。当世界的错误本应激励你时，它们又怎么能阻止你呢？如果正确看待，它们只会促使你现在更加全身心地投入你的准备工作。你所进行的这个准备承诺将激发你内在的内识。你只需跟随它的步伐。</p><p>You will not find refuge in the world. You have already attempted this, and it has failed you again and again, as it will fail you again and again if you pursue it any further. It is you who must give to the world because it is you who have Knowledge.</p><p>你不会在世界中找到庇护。你已经尝试过了，它一次又一次地让你失望，如果你继续追寻，它还会一次又一次地让你失望。是你必须给予这个世界，因为是你拥有内识。</p><p>Therefore, receive Knowledge this day in your hourly practices and in your deeper practice periods. Do not let the errors of the world dissuade you. Let the errors of the world prompt you and inspire you towards Knowledge, for this is part of the gift of the world to you. The other part of the gift of the world is to be the arena where you allow Knowledge to contribute itself through you. Here the world is blessed and you are blessed. Then you will be grateful for the errors of the world and for the accomplishments of the world, for one stimulates Knowledge and the other fulfills Knowledge. Therefore, this day learn to think correctly so that your mind may be a useful servant to Knowledge and so that all aspects of yourself may be honored.</p><p>因此，在你今天的整点练习和深度练习时接收内识。不要让世界的错误阻止你。让世界的错误促使你并激励你走向内识，因为这是世界给予你礼物的一部分。世界礼物的另一部分是成为一个舞台，让内识通过你贡献它自身。在这里，世界得到了祝福，你也得到了祝福。然后，你会对世界的错误和成就心怀感激，因为一个激发了内识，另一个实现了内识。因此，今天学习正确的思考，使你的心灵成为内识可用的服务者，让你自己的各个方面都能得到尊重。</p><p>Practice 255: Two 30-minute practice periods.

They are here to initiate Knowledge within you, to remind you of your origin and your destiny and to guide you in matters great and small. Trust your Teachers. They will not take the place of your Knowledge but will step back as Knowledge comes forward within you. Trust your Teachers, for they have already accomplished what you are now attempting, and they are teaching it to you now so that they may fulfill their destiny in the world. Trust your Teachers, for they have no goal or ambition other than Knowledge. Thus, their approach to you is entirely uniform and honest—without deception, confusion or conflict of mind. </p><p>信任你的老师，因为他们是完全值得信赖的。他们在这里是为了在你内心启动内识，提醒你，你的起源和你的天命，并在大小事物上指导你。信任你的老师。他们不会代替你的内识，而是在你内在的内识显现时退后。信任你的老师，因为他们已经完成了你现在正在尝试的事情，他们现在正在教导你，以便他们可以在这个世界上实现他们的天命。信任你的老师，因为他们没有任何目标或雄心，除了内识。因此，他们对你的方法是完全一致和诚实的——没有心灵的欺骗、困惑或冲突。</p><p>As you learn to receive your Teachers, you will learn to receive their approach to life. In this, they will give you harmony, balance, power and direction. You cannot respond to honesty dishonestly. You must learn to respond to honesty with honesty. You must learn to respond to direction with a desire for direction. You must learn to respond to commitment with commitment. Thus, in your response to your Teachers, you learn how to respond. You learn to value what is valuable, and you learn to release or overlook what is meaningless. </p><p>当你学会接纳你的老师时，你将学会接纳他们对生命的态度。在这方面，他们会给你和谐、平衡、力量和方向。你不能对诚实作出不诚实的回应。你必须学会以诚实回应诚实。你必须学会以渴望得到指引来回应指引。你必须学会以承诺回应承诺。因此，在你对老师的回应中，你将学会如何回应。你将学会珍惜有价值的事物，学会放下或忽视无意义的事物。</p><p>As you trust your Teachers, you will trust yourself. Remember this upon the hour. In your two times of great refuge and happiness, in meditation, return to your Teachers whom you now trust. In stillness and in silence they will abide with you, and you may bathe in the depth of their love. You may experience their universal affection and receive their grace, which will only stimulate your Knowledge, for only your Knowledge will be stimulated.</p><p>当你信任你的老师时，你会信任你自己。记住这一点，在整点时刻。在你两次深度的庇护和快乐时段中，在冥想中，回到你现在信任的老师身边。在静止和静默中，他们会与你同在，你可以在他们的爱中沐浴。你可以体验到他们的普遍关爱并接受他们的恩典，这只会激发你的内识，因为只有你的内识才会被激发。</p><p>Practice 254: Two 30-minute practice periods.

Yet even here you can realize that those things that you truly needed for the advancement of Knowledge and for the advancement of your true mental and physical capabilities were provided for you. </p><p>你必须对这个声明给予你全部的信仰，尽管你的过去充满了挫折和失望。但是，即使在这里，你也可以意识到，曾经为你提供的那些事物，正是你在内识的进步和你真实的心理、生理能力的提升中所真正需要的。</p><p>All things you truly need will be provided. It is when you want things that you do not truly need that your awareness of this becomes confused, and this leads you into dark speculation and grave disappointment. What you need will make you happy; what you don’t need will make you confused. This is very simple, very straightforward and very direct. Knowledge is always like that. Knowledge affirms that which is essential. Here your approach to life becomes simple and direct. Thus, you experience life as simple and direct. </p><p>所有你真正需要的一切都将为你提供。当你想要一些你并不真正需要的事物时，你对此的觉知就会变得困惑，从而导致你陷入黑暗的猜测和严重的失望。你需要的事物会让你快乐；你不需要的事物会让你困惑。这是非常简单、非常直白、非常直接的。内识总是这样。内识肯定了必不可少的事物。在这里，你的生命态度变得简单而直接。因此，你将会体验到简单而直接的生命。</p><p>If you approach life in a devious way, life will appear devious to you. If you approach life with simplicity and honesty, life will appear simple and honest to you. Knowledge will indicate that which is truly needed and that which is extraneous, those things that you must carry and those which are merely extra baggage that will burden you. If you want what is unnecessary and devote yourself to that, you will lose touch with what is real and genuine, and your life will become confused and unhappy.</p><p>如果你以狡诈的态度对待生命，生命对你来说就会显得狡诈。如果你以简单和诚实的态度对待生命，生命对你来说就会显得简单和诚实。内识会指引你辨识出哪些是真正需要的，以及哪些是无关紧要的，哪些是你必须携带的，以及哪些只是额外的负担。如果你想要那些不必要的事物，并将你自己投入其中，你将会与实际和真挚的内识失去联系，生命也会变得困惑和不快乐。</p><p>Speak these words upon the hour and consider them. Life around you will demonstrate that they are true. In your deeper meditation practices, enter stillness once again. Direct your effort on your own behalf, and your mind will respond to your command. It is your desire for Knowledge that will let all things come to you. This confidence in life will give you the assurance to proceed. This confidence in life will give you the assurance that your life is highly valued in the world. This confidence in life will affirm that which guides life itself, for within life there is Knowledge and there is fantasy, but life itself is Knowledge.</p><p>在每小时的整点时刻，重复这些话并加以思考。你周围的生命将会证明它们的真实性。在你更深入的冥想练习中，再次进入静止。把你的努力投入到你自己的利益上，你的心灵会响应你的命令。是你对内识的渴望，才会让万事万物向你走来。对生命的这种确信将给予你前进的力量。对生命的这种信心将使你确信，你的生命在这个世界上是极为珍贵的。这份信心将确认引导生命本身的力量，因为生命中既有内识，也有幻想，但生命本身就是内识。</p><p>Practice 253: Two 30-minute practice periods.

You will realize this as you review your practices, for your practices demonstrate your ambivalence towards Knowledge and the presence of Knowledge itself. </p><p>让过去两周对每一课的回顾成为你生命中内识存在的确认。回顾每一课和每一次练习。客观地回顾你的参与程度，并意识到你有机会更全面、更彻底地给予你自己。意识到你的否认是多么没有意义，以及在生命中参与所带来的伟大回报的承诺。当你回顾你的实践时，你就会意识到这一点，因为你的实践展示了你对内识的矛盾心态，以及内识本身的存在。</p><p>You will learn in time that as you come closer to Knowledge, all things that are meaningful and valuable will be affirmed, and as you go away from Knowledge, you will enter the darkness of your own imagination. This, then, will convince you of where you need to apply yourself. This will convince you of the great presence that is with you to assist you. This will convince you that you are included in life and that your Teachers are with you. Whatever obstacle or inadequacy that you can recognize or imagine can be easily overcome with Knowledge. It is your desire for Knowledge and your capacity for Knowledge that need to be strengthened. And once this is done, Knowledge will express itself and you will be the beneficiary of life’s greatest gift.</p><p>随着时间的推移，你会学习到，当你接近内识时，所有有意义、有价值的事物都会得到肯定，而当你远离内识时，你将进入你自己想象的黑暗之中。这样，你将确信你自己应该在哪里努力。这将让你确信，伟大的存在与你同在，为你提供援助。你将确信你是生命的一部分，你的老师与你同在。任何你能认识到或想象到的障碍或不足，都可以用内识轻松克服。需要加强的是你对内识的渴望以及你对内识的接受能力。一旦做到了这一点，内识就会表达它自身，你将成为生命中最伟大礼物的受益者。</p><p>In your longer Review today, allow yourself to undertake your practice with great depth and sincerity. Allow this day to affirm your studenthood. Allow this day to affirm that you have been saved.</p><p>在今天较长时间的回顾中，允许你自己以伟大的深度和诚意开展实践。让这一天肯定你的学生身份。让这一天肯定你已获救。</p><p>Practice 252: One long practice period.</p><p>练习 252 ：一段漫长的练习期</p>]]></content>

      <title>第二百五十一阶：如果我遵循内识，在我的关系中将没有困惑。</title>
      <link href="/2024/12/01/251/"/>
      <url>/2024/12/01/251/</url>
      
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="STEP-251-IF-I-ABIDE-WITH-KNOWLEDGE-THERE-WILL-BE-NO-CONFUSION-IN-MY-RELATIONSHIPS"><a href="#STEP-251-IF-I-ABIDE-WITH-KNOWLEDGE-THERE-WILL-BE-NO-CONFUSION-IN-MY-RELATIONSHIPS" class="headerlink" title="STEP 251 IF I ABIDE WITH KNOWLEDGE, THERE WILL BE NO CONFUSION IN MY RELATIONSHIPS"></a>STEP 251 IF I ABIDE WITH KNOWLEDGE, THERE WILL BE NO CONFUSION IN MY RELATIONSHIPS</h2><p>If Knowledge is not confused, how can you be confused who abide in Knowledge? To abide with Knowledge, however, means that you are not attempting to resolve things, to understand things, to control or to persuade things without Knowledge. You are not attempting to fulfill your specialness by using another to enhance it. You are not attempting to substantiate your errors by casting blame upon another. </p><p>如果内识不是困惑的，那么与内识同在的你又如何会困惑呢？然而，遵循内识意味着你不会在没有内识的情况下试图解决事情、理解事情、控制或说服事情。你不会试图通过利用他人来增强你的特殊性。你不会试图通过将错误归咎于他人来证明你的错误。</p><p>With Knowledge there is no confusion in relationships. You know who to be with and who not to be with, and there is no blame in this. You know where to devote yourself and where not to devote yourself, and there is no condemnation in this. You choose this over that, not right over wrong. You go here not there because here is where you must go. How simple this is and how totally effective. This affirms Knowledge in all individuals, and no one is condemned. Here the gates of hell are opened and all are free to return to Knowledge, for the gates of hell are open already, and Knowledge is calling to all who dwell there to return to God. For what is hell but life without God and life without Knowledge? It is life imagined, that is all. </p><p>有了内识，关系就不会混乱。你知道该和谁在一起，不该和谁在一起，这其中没有责备。你知道该在哪里奉献你自己，不该在哪里奉献你自己，这其中没有谴责。你选择这个而不是那个，选择对而不是错。你去这里而不是那里，因为这里是你必须去的地方。这是多么简单，又多么完全有效。这肯定了所有个人的内识，而没有人会被定罪。在这里，地狱之门已经打开，所有人都可以自由地回到内识，因为地狱之门已经打开，内识正在召唤住在地狱的所有人回归上帝。除了没有上帝和没有内识的生命，地狱还能是什么？它只是想象中的生命，仅此而已。</p><p>Therefore, receive the call of Knowledge, which is the call of God for you to awaken and participate with life. You can do nothing alone, and your relationships will be clear when you abide with Knowledge. Remember this upon the hour and in your two longer practice periods today, dedicate yourself to actively looking at every single primary relationship involvement that you have had. Recognize in them the frustrations and the confusion, the great expectations and the great disappointments, the bitterness over error, the sense of failure and the projections of blame. Then realize that with Knowledge none of this need be, for with Knowledge the meaning and purpose of each relationship was recognized at the beginning of your involvement and was affirmed at the end. </p><p>因此，接收内识的召唤，这是上帝召唤你醒来并参与生命的召唤。你无法单独做任何事情，当你遵循内识时，你的关系将变得清晰。记住这一点，在今天的两个较长的练习时段中，专心审视你所经历的每一段主要关系。在这些关系中，你会看到挫折与困惑、巨大的期望与巨大的失望、对错误的苦涩、失败感以及对他人的责怪投射。然后意识到，在内识中这一切都是不必存在的，因为有了内识，你会在你参与的开始就认识到每段关系的意义和目的，并在结束时得到确认。</p><p>Realize in your current relationships that with Knowledge all things will be clear, and you may proceed without guilt or blame and without compulsion or need. With Knowledge you may follow that which is precisely beneficial to you and to your beloved, for all relationships are honored and blessed through Knowledge, and all individuals find their rightful place with one another. In this, each person is honored and his or her Knowledge is confirmed. Let this be your understanding today.</p><p>意识到在你当前的关系中，有了内识，一切都会清晰，你可以没有愧疚或没有自责，也没有强迫或需求。在内识中，你可以跟随对你和你所爱之人真正有益的事情，因为所有的关系通过内识得到尊重和祝福，所有个体都找到了他们与他人之间应有的位置。在这一点上，每个人都受到尊重，他或她的内识也得到了确认。让这成为你今天的理解。</p><p>Practice 251: Two 30-minute practice periods. Hourly practice.</p><p>练习 251 ：两个 30 分钟的练习时段，每小时练习。</p>]]></content>

Do not betray your Knowledge today by holding yourself apart. Do not punish yourself for errors which have no substance and which are in fact only an expression of confusion. There is no justification for error, and there is no justification for holding yourself apart. You are a part of life and you will need to rely upon your relationships with others and with life as a whole to accomplish anything, even to survive. </p><p>你只能在幻想中独自一人，而幻想不会给你带来任何有价值、持久或有意义的事物。今天不要通过与你自己分离来背叛你的内识。不要因无实质内容的错误而惩罚你自己，这些错误实际上只是混乱的表现。错误是没有理由的，而与你自己分离也是没有理由的。你是生命的一部分，你需要依赖你与他人以及与整体生命的关系来完成任何事情，甚至是生存。</p><p>As you think about this, gratitude will naturally arise within you, and you will realize that the ground upon which you walk and everything that you see and touch that is useful and beneficial is the result of giving and cooperation. Then your gratitude will bring forth love naturally, and from your love you will begin to understand how all things are accomplished in the universe. This will give you strength and the assurance of what you yourself must learn to do.</p><p>当你思考这一点时，感恩自然会在你内心涌现，你会意识到你所行走的土地，以及你所看到和触及的一切有用且有益的事物，都是给予与合作的结果。然后，你的感恩会自然而然地引发爱，从你的爱中，你将开始理解宇宙中万物是如何完成的。这将给你力量，并让你确信你自己必须学会做的事情。</p><p>Upon the hour remember this, and in your deeper meditations allow yourself to receive. Do not hold yourself apart from Knowledge, which waits to bless you in your meditation practices. This is when you come to the altar of God to present yourself, and here God presents God to you who are learning to receive Knowledge.</p><p>每小时提醒你自己这一点，在你更深层次的冥想中，允许你自己去接收。不要将你自己与内识分离，内识正等待在你的冥想实践中祝福你。这时你来到上帝的圣坛，向上帝呈现你自己，在这里，上帝向你呈现上帝，而你正在学会接收内识。</p><p>Practice 250: Two 30-minute practice periods. Hourly practice.</p><p>练习 250 ：两个 30 分钟的练习时段。每小时练习。</p>]]></content>

      <title>第二百四十九阶：独自一人，我什么都做不到。</title>
      <link href="/2024/12/01/249/"/>
      <url>/2024/12/01/249/</url>
      
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="STEP-249-ALONE-I-CAN-DO-NOTHING"><a href="#STEP-249-ALONE-I-CAN-DO-NOTHING" class="headerlink" title="STEP 249 ALONE I CAN DO NOTHING."></a>STEP 249 ALONE I CAN DO NOTHING.</h2><p>Alone you can do nothing, for nothing in life is done alone. This is so very obvious if you simply observe the activity around you. No one is doing anything alone. This is so very true; it cannot be denied if you look upon the world honestly. Even if you were alone on a mountaintop without another soul in sight, you would not be alone, for your Teachers would be with you, and everything that you would accomplish there would be a joint effort, as everything that you accomplish with other people is a joint effort. This affirms the intrinsic nature of relationships and gives complete evidence to the fact that nothing can be done alone. In this, you must learn to value your relationships, for they are the vehicles for accomplishment in all areas and in all avenues of expression. </p><p>独自一人，你什么都做不到，因为生命中的一切都不是单独完成的。如果你只是观察你周围的活动，这一点就会非常明显。没有人在单独做任何事情。这是非常真实的；如果你诚实地看待这个世界，它是无法否认的。即使你独自一人站在山顶，视野中没有一个人影，你也不会孤单，因为你的老师会与你同在，你在这里所成就的一切都将是共同的努力，就像你与他人一起成就的一切一样。这确认了关系的内在自然，也充分证明了没有什么事情是可以单独完成的。在这一点上，你必须学会珍视你的关系，因为它们是你在所有领域和所有表达途径中成就的载体。</p><p>Therefore, We emphasize the value of your relationships to you who now seek to reclaim Knowledge. These relationships must be imbued with the Knowledge that you are reclaiming. Then they will have the stability, the efficacy and the grace that Knowledge contains for you. For only relationships based upon Knowledge can carry the Wisdom that Knowledge will exert within the world. Relationships based upon personal attraction or personal fantasy do not have the foundation to carry Knowledge and will fail abruptly in the presence of the demands and requirements of a true life. </p><p>因此，我们强调你在寻求恢复内识时，关系对你的价值。这些关系必须充满你正在恢复的内识。这样，它们将拥有内识为你所包含的稳定性、效力和优雅。因为只有基于内识的关系才能承载内识在世界中所展现的智慧。基于个人吸引力或个人幻想的关系没有基础去承载内识，并且在面对真实生命的需求和要求时，会突然失败。</p><p>Therefore, as you reclaim Knowledge, you also learn the lessons of relationships. Remind yourself of this upon the hour and witness the obviousness of today’s lesson in whatever context you find yourself. If you look, you will see that nothing can be done alone—on any level, in any avenue. Nothing can be done alone. There is no individual creativity. There is no individual contribution. There is no individual invention. The only thing that can be made alone is fantasy, and in this a great deal has been produced. But even this is shared and fortified as each individual fortifies it within his or her own imagination. Therefore, even illusion is shared and substantiated through relationship. Nothing can be done alone. Even illusion cannot be done alone. There is no escape from this. Yet the fact that there is no escape from life is the true promise of your redemption, for here life will redeem you, and all that you have brought into the world will be activated and contributed.</p><p>因此，当你恢复内识时，你也在学习关系的课程。每小时提醒你自己这一点，并见证今天课程的显而易见性，无论你身处何种情境。如果你观察，你会发现没有什么是能单独完成的——在任何层面，任何大道。没有什么能单独完成。没有个人的创造力。没有个人的贡献。没有个人的发明。唯一能单独创造的只有幻想，而在这一点上，已经创造了很多。但即便如此，这些幻想也是通过每个人在他&#x2F;她自己想象中巩固而共享的。因此，甚至幻想也是通过关系共享并得到证实的。没有什么能单独完成。即使幻想也不能单独完成。没有人能逃避这一点。然而，事实是你无法逃避生命，这才是你救赎的真实承诺，因为在这里，生命将救赎你，而你带到这个世界的一切将被激活并做出贡献。</p><p>In your deeper practice periods today, bring yourself to Knowledge and bring yourself to your Teachers in stillness and humility. Realize that you can do nothing alone. Even your attempt to discipline your mind and to prepare yourself for meditation is something you share with others who are practicing and with your Teachers as well. All power of God can be expressed through you, for nothing can be done alone.</p><p>在今天的更深层次的练习时段中，将你自己带到内识面前，将你自己带到你的老师面前，在静止与谦逊中。意识到你独自一人什么也做不了。即使你努力训练你的心灵，准备进行冥想，这也是你与其他正在练习的人以及你的老师共同分享的事。上帝的所有力量都能通过你表达，因为没有什么是能单独完成的。</p><p>Practice 249: Two 30-minute practice periods. Hourly practice.</p><p>练习 249 ：两个 30 分钟的练习时段。每小时练习。</p>]]></content>

Do not rely upon yourself alone, for alone you know nothing. Alone, there is no Knowledge and no relationship. Rely upon the Wisdom of the universe, which is available to you within your Knowledge, which is stimulated by the presence of your Teachers. Do not think that you alone can do anything, for alone you can do nothing. But together with life, all things that are intended for your fulfillment and your greatest contribution are indicated and are so promised. </p><p>依靠宇宙的智慧。不要只依靠你自己，因为独自一人的你什么都不知道。独自一人，没有内识，也没有关系。依靠宇宙的智慧，这是你的内识所能提供的，而你的内识是由你的老师所激发的。不要认为你一个人可以做任何事，因为你一个人什么也做不了。但是，与生命一起，所有为你的成就与最大贡献而设定的事情都会被指明，并得到承诺。</p><p>Therefore, remind yourself of this idea upon the hour and within your meditation practices, once again seek the refuge of Knowledge in stillness and in silence. Allow the Wisdom of the universe to express itself to you who are learning to receive this Wisdom in openness and in humility.</p><p>因此，每小时提醒你自己这个想法，并在冥想练习中再次通过静止与静默寻求内识的庇护。让宇宙的智慧向你表达，你正在学习以开放和谦逊来接收这种智慧。</p><p>Allow this day to be a day of listening, a day of contemplation and a day of receptivity. Do not fall prey to habitual judgments or preoccupations, but allow this day to be a day of true access to life so that life may give unto you who are its servant.</p><p>让今天成为聆听的一天、沉思的一天、接受的一天。不要陷入习惯性的判断或分心之中，而是让这一天成为真实接触生命的一天，以便生命能够给予你，作为它服务者的你。</p><p>Practice 248: Two 30-minute practice periods.

Accept their counsel and work with it,  realizing that only by following counsel will you understand its meaning and its value. </p><p>聆听你的内在老师，因为他们有智慧的忠告要传达给你。接受他们的忠告，并与之合作，意识到只有通过遵循忠告，你才能理解其意义和价值。</p><p>Take time upon the hour to remind yourself that your Inner Teachers are with you. Look forward to those two times in meditation today when you will be free from external obligations and involvements to spend time with your Inner Teachers. They will speak to you this day and help you to learn to listen and to discern their voice from other voices that plague your mind. They represent the one true voice that will speak unto your soul. They are not the substitutes that you create to keep yourself stimulated in fear. Therefore, extend your trust to them as they have extended their trust to you, for they are entrusting you with Knowledge in the world—a greater form of trust and acknowledgment you cannot imagine. For you to be the vehicle of Knowledge in the world, you must bear witness to the greatness of your origin and heritage and the greatness of God’s estimation of you.</p><p>每隔一小时就花点时间提醒你自己，你的内在老师与你同在。期待今天冥想中的两个时段，那时你将从外部的责任和事务中解脱出来，与你的内在老师共度时光。他们今天会对你讲话，帮助你学会聆听，并辨别他们的声音与其他困扰你心灵的声音。它们代表着那唯一的真实的声音，将向你的灵魂讲话。它们不是你为了保持你自己因恐惧而被刺激的替代品。因此，像他们对你所给予的信任一样，向他们伸出你的信任，因为他们正在把内识托付给你——这是一种你无法想象的更伟大的信任和认可。为了成为世界上内识的载体，你必须见证你自身的起源和传承的伟大，以及上帝对你的评价的伟大。</p><p>Therefore, in your two deeper practices this day, in stillness and silence, turn your listening inward. Listen intently. Allow yourself to become receptive and you will know your Teachers are standing in the background, observing you, loving you and supporting you. And they will speak to you this day of things beyond the world and things within the world. They will remind you of your purpose and your function as you learn to listen this day.</p><p>因此，在今天的两次深度练习中，在静止和静默中，将你的聆听转向内在。专心聆听。允许你自己变得具有接纳性，你将知道你的老师们正站在背后，观察你，爱你，并支持你。他们今天会对你讲述超越世界的事物和世界内的事物。在你学习聆听的这一天，他们会提醒你，你的目的和功能。</p><p>Practice 247: Two 30-minute practice periods.

There is no justification for denying Knowledge. There is no justification at all. Do not attempt to justify your errors by projecting blame upon yourself or by accusing life of not giving you what you need. Do not justify your errors by claiming the responsibility of your childhood, your parents or your upbringing in determining your current situation. Errors cannot be justified. Whatever cannot be justified can be relinquished, for it lacks true meaning and value. </p><p>错误是没有理由的。否认内识是没有理由的。没有任何理由。不要试图通过将责任归咎于你自己，或者指责生命没有给予你所需的东西，来为你的错误辩解。不要通过将你的现状归因于童年、父母或成长经历来为你的错误找借口。错误是无法被辩解的。凡是无法被辩解的事情，都可以被放弃，因为它缺乏真正的意义和价值。</p><p>Today, then, is a form of freedom, an expression of freedom to you who still, out of habit and complacency, attempt to justify your errors by assigning blame and responsibility. This is meaningless, for today you are only given to come to Knowledge and to give yourself in your approach to Knowledge. You can only justify error as an excuse not to come to Knowledge, and since there is no justification for error, there is no justification for you not to come to Knowledge. Without this justification, you are justified, for you are the expression of Knowledge. That is your destiny and purpose in the world. If error is unjustified, the truth is given all justification.</p><p>因此，今天是自由的一种形式，是向你表达自由的一天，因为你仍然出于习惯和自满，试图通过指责和责任来为你的错误辩解。这是没有意义的，因为今天你唯一需要做的就是走向内识，并全心投入到追求内识的道路上。你只能将错误的理由作为不走向内识的借口，而既然错误没有理由，那么你没有理由不走向内识。没有了这些借口，你便获得了正当性，因为你是内识的表达。这是你在世界上的天命和目的。如果错误没有理由，那么真理便拥有了所有的正当性。</p><p>Allow yourself to repeat this idea upon the hour. Come to this in your longer practice periods in stillness and receptivity. Be grateful today that your errors have been forgiven. Be grateful today that condemnation is not justified. Be grateful today that you have this opportunity to come to Knowledge, which will affirm that which is truest and greatest within you. Be grateful today that there is no justification in denying this, for without guilt and blame you can only receive that which life has to offer you. </p><p>允许你自己在每小时中重复这个想法。在较长的练习时间里，保持静止和接纳。今天，要感恩你的错误已被宽恕。今天，要感恩谴责是没有理由的。今天，要感恩你有机会走向内识，内识将肯定你内心最真实、最伟大的部分。今天，要感恩没有否认内识的理由，因为没有了内疚和责备，你只能接收生命所要给予你的礼物。</p><p>Let this be a day to celebrate your freedom. Let this be a day to affirm that you are blameless, for you are a student of Knowledge. Let this be a day to affirm that all the problems of the world can be solved without condemnation, for without condemnation all problems in the world will be solved.</p><p>让今天成为庆祝你自由的一天。让今天成为确认你是无可指责的一天，因为你是内识的学生。让今天成为确认世界上所有问题都能在没有谴责的情况下得到解决的一天，因为没有谴责，世界上的所有问题都会被解决。</p><p>Practice 246: Two 30-minute practice periods.

Let your need for Knowledge not be underestimated. Thus, you need not respond with condemnation or judgment upon those who fail, but realize their great need and your great need. This will only confirm, then, the depth with which you must now prepare yourself. For you prepare yourself not only for your own advancement and fulfillment, but for the advancement and fulfillment of humanity. This is no idle claim or statement. It is absolutely the truth. For every step you take towards Knowledge, you give your accomplishment to the world, and you lessen the burden of all who struggle with their own fantasies and sense of failure. </p><p>当他人失败时，让这提醒你对内识的需求。不要低估你对内识的需求。因此，你不需要以谴责或评判的方式回应那些失败的人，而是要认识到他们的伟大需求以及你自己的伟大需求。这将进一步确认你现在必须如何深入地准备你自己。因为你不仅是为你自己的进步和成就而准备你自己的，也是为了整个人类的进步和成就。这不是一个空洞的声明，它是绝对的真理。因为你每迈向内识的一步，你的成就都会给予整个世界，并减轻所有为幻想和失败感而挣扎的人们的负担。</p><p>Your life, then, becomes your teaching, for it is a life of Knowledge. It demonstrates the presence of Knowledge in the world, which is the presence of God. This happens as a result of your serving as an advanced vehicle for Knowledge. In your advancement all human capabilities are furthered, all human liabilities are dissipated and that which is most true and genuine in individual human life in the world is exalted. And that which is beyond all human life, but which contains human life, is affirmed as well. Therefore, another’s failure is a call for your involvement with Knowledge. It is a call for your advancement and strengthening because you have come into the world to give. </p><p>因此，你的生命就成了你的教导，因为这是一种有内识的生命。它体现了内识在世界上的存在，也就是上帝的存在。这是通过你作为一个内识的先进载体而实现的。在你的进步中，所有人类的能力都会得到加强，所有人类的弱点都会被削弱，个人生命中最真实和最真诚的部分会被提升。而超越所有人类生命但又包含人类生命的内识也会因此被肯定。因此，他人的失败是对你与内识参与的召唤。这是对你成长和加强的召唤，因为你来到这个世界是为了给予。</p><p>Remind yourself of this upon the hour and in your two longer practice periods, actively engage your mind in comprehending this idea. Think of every individual that you think has failed and realize the meaning of today’s lesson in light of those individuals serving you. Realize the need for Knowledge within their lives and within your life. They are committing errors to spark your commitment to Knowledge. They are serving you in this regard, and this calls for your gratitude not your condemnation. They are teaching you to value the valuable and to release the meaningless. Think not they are not saving you time. They are saving you time. They are demonstrating that which you need to learn and to accept. Therefore, commit yourself to their well-being for teaching you to value Knowledge. As you value Knowledge, the result of your value will be given back to them in return, and they will be strengthened and honored by your accomplishment.</p><p>每小时提醒你自己这一点，并在两个较长的练习时段中，积极地让你的心灵理解这个想法。想想每一个你认为失败的个人，并在今天课程的启发下，认识到这些人对你的帮助。意识到他们生命中以及你生命中对内识的需求。他们通过错误来激发你对内识的承诺。在这方面，他们在为你服务，这要求你的感激而非谴责。他们在教你重视有价值的内识，并放下无意义的事物。不要认为他们没有为你节省时间。他们正在为你节省时间。他们在向你展示你需要学习和接受的内识。因此，感谢他们为教导你内识的价值而承诺他们的福祉。当你重视内识时，这种价值的结果会以回馈的方式给予他们，他们会因你的成就而得到力量并受到尊重。</p><p>Practice 245: Two 30-minute practice periods. Hourly practice.</p><p>练习 245 ：两次 30 分钟的练习时段。每小时练习。</p>]]></content>

When they are strong, you are honored. In this way, Knowledge affirms itself in the world, where Knowledge has been forgotten. Knowledge need only be affirmed through experience and expression to be given to others. Your greatest teaching in this life is the contribution of your life as it is demonstrated to others. Indeed, this is your greatest gift to yourself, for as your life is demonstrated in its value to you, your estimation of yourself will be redeemed, and you will understand your true value in proportion to life itself. </p><p>当你强大时，他人感到被尊重。当他们强大时，你感到被尊重。通过这种方式，内识在这个遗忘内识的世界中得到肯定。内识只需通过体验和表达来确认，就能传递给他人。在这个生命中，你最伟大的教导是你的生命向他人展示的贡献。事实上，这也是你给予你自己的最伟大礼物，因为当你的生命对你展现其价值时，你对你自己的评估将得到恢复，你就会理解你的真实价值与生命本身是成正比的。</p><p>Therefore, when others are strong, you are honored. In this way, you will not seek to belittle another to strengthen yourself. You will not seek to affirm your advantage based upon another’s disadvantage. In this way, no guilt will attend your accomplishment, for no one has been betrayed as you seek to gain experience and advancement in life.</p><p>因此，当他人强大时，你感到被尊重。通过这种方式，你将不会通过贬低他人来增强你自己。你将不会通过他人的劣势来肯定你自己的优势。通过这种方式，你的成就不会伴随内疚感，因为在你寻求生命体验和进步的过程中，没有人遭到背叛。</p><p>The lesson for today is very deep and will require much consideration. Upon the hour repeat the idea for today and give it serious consideration in every circumstance in which you find yourself. In your deeper practices today, enter stillness and silence. Allow yourself this gift because the idea for today is very simple and very true. It is in no way complex, though it will require serious consideration, for you are far too used to entertaining only things of superficial value. Throughout Our training together in these days, weeks and months, you are learning to engage your mind to recognize what is obvious and apparent, but which has not yet been apparent to you who have entertained yourself with shallow things. </p><p>今天的教导是非常有深度的，需要你认真思考。在每小时的练习中重复今天的想法，并在你所处的每一个环境中认真考虑它。在今天的深度练习中，进入静止与寂静之中。允许你自己收到这份礼物，因为今天的想法非常简单且真实。它一点也不复杂，但会需要你认真考虑，因为你习惯于只关注表面的事物。在我们一起的这些日子、周和月中，你正在学习运用你的心灵去认出那些显而易见但你尚未注意到的事物，因为你过去一直沉溺于浅薄的事物。</p><p>Therefore, today let this time be given to Knowledge. Let this time be given to that which strengthens you and all other individuals in the universe. When others are strong, you are honored. In this, all separation ends, and true giving becomes apparent.</p><p>因此，今天让这段时间交给内识。让这段时间献给那些使你和宇宙中所有个体变得强大的力量。当他人强大时，你感到被尊重。在这一点上，所有的分离都会结束，真实的给予变得显而易见。</p><p>Practice 244: Two 30-minute practice periods.

All human ambition that is not born of Knowledge is born of the attempt to offset the grave disappointment and great anxiety of separation. The attempt to be special is the attempt to fortify separation. It is the attempt to make yourself greater at the expense of others. It always denies life and Knowledge and always leads to greater confusion, frustration and despair. </p><p>试图变得特别是所有人类野心的根源。所有不源自内识的人类野心都源于试图抵消分离所带来的深刻失望和巨大焦虑。试图变得特别是试图巩固分离。这是让你自己以他人为代价变得更大的尝试。这种企图总是否定生命和内识，总是导致更大的困惑、挫败和绝望。</p><p>You are freed this day from attempting to make yourself special, for in this way you will find the true relief that you have sought in all of your previous endeavors. What is special in you is your unique form of expression of that which is inherent in all life. Then that which joins life and is life is affirmed. Your individuality is affirmed as well, but not to the exclusion of the value of any other expression of life. Here you are not special. You are simply you. You are greater than an individual because you are part of life, and yet you are an individual because you express life individually. Here all conflict and confusion end. That which is limited expresses that which is unlimited, and that which is unique expresses that which is inherent and intrinsic. This is the resolution that you seek, for you do not really wish to be special. You only wish to have your individual life have purpose, meaning and direction.</p><p>今天，你从试图让你自己变得特别的努力中解放出来，因为通过这种方式，你将找到在以往所有努力中所追寻的真实解脱。你内在的特别之处在于，你以独特的形式表达了所有生命所固有的内识。这样，连接生命并即是生命的内识得到了肯定。你的个体性也得到了肯定，但并没有排斥任何其他生命表达的价值。在这里，你不是特别的，你只是你自己。你比个体更伟大，因为你是生命的一部分；然而，你又是个体，因为你以个人的方式表达生命。在这里，所有的冲突和困惑都结束了。有限的存在表达了无限的内识，独特的个体表达了固有的内识。这就是你所寻求的解答，因为你并不真正希望变得特别。你只是希望你的个人生命能拥有目的、意义和方向。</p><p>Upon the hour think of this after you repeat the idea for today. In your deeper practices, enter into stillness and peace once again. Do not petition for answers because you do not need to do this in your meditation practices. Your time now is to practice receiving Knowledge, in which your individuality is honored and confirmed for its true purpose and in which your specialness, which has only been a grave and impossible burden for you, is gently lifted from your shoulders. Do not seek to be special today, for that is not the purpose of your life. Then all fear of death and destruction will leave you. Then all judgment and comparison with others will leave you. Then you will be able to honor life and honor your relationships, which are an expression of everything today’s lesson will teach you.</p><p>每小时重复今天的想法后，思考这一点。在你的深入练习中，再次进入静止与和平。不要在冥想练习中寻求答案，因为你不需要这样做。你现在的时间是练习接收内识，在这里，你的个体性因其真实的目的而被尊重和确认，而你的独特性——这个对你来说一直是沉重而不可能的负担——将被轻轻地从你肩上移开。今天不要试图变得特别，因为这不是你生命的目的。这样，所有对死亡和毁灭的恐惧将离开你。这样，所有对他人的评判和比较将离开你。这样，你将能够尊重生命并尊重你的关系，而这些关系正是今天课程将教给你的所有内容的体现。</p><p>Practice 243: Two 30-minute practice periods.

It is the gift that imbues all other giving and gives it meaning. This is the gift that gives value to all human expression, all human endeavor and all human invention that is intended to support the well-being of humanity in its evolution. Knowledge is not something that you can quantify and give, as if you put it into a package or delineate it with your ideas. It is a presence and a quality of life that is the very essence of life. It makes all giving and contribution meaningful. </p><p>这是你最伟大的礼物。它赋予所有其他给予的意义，使其充满价值。这是赋予所有人类表达、所有人类努力以及所有旨在支持人类进化福祉的发明价值的礼物。内识并不是可以量化或像打包一样传递的事物，也不是可以用你的想法来描述的事物。它是一种存在，是一种生命的品质，是生命的精髓。它让所有的给予和贡献都变得有意义。</p><p>This is your greatest gift, which you are now learning to receive. As you receive it, it will give itself naturally, for you cannot keep Knowledge for yourself. Once it emerges, it begins to express itself in all directions and specifically in certain directions and in certain involvements with certain people according to its design and Wisdom. Thus, if you receive Knowledge, it must be given. It will give itself, and you will want to give it because you possess wealth, and wealth can only be increased through giving. Thus, in essence, life is all about the giving of Knowledge. Wherever this giving cannot be accomplished, there is all manner of deception, disappointment and despair. But when giving is reactivated in these circumstances, these qualities of denial will be dispelled, and Knowledge will once again begin to express itself in very specific ways. </p><p>这是你最伟大的礼物，而你现在正在学习接收它。当你接收它时，内识将自然地给予它自身，因为你不能将内识只留给你自己。一旦它显现出来，它就会朝各个方向表达它自身，并特别在特定的方向和特定的人与特定的事务的联系中表达它自身，这都是根据它的设计和智慧进行的。因此，如果你接收内识，它就必须被给予。它会自行给予，而你也会想要给予它，因为你拥有了财富，而财富只有通过给予才能增长。因此，本质上，生命就是关于内识的给予。在无法实现这种给予的地方，各种欺骗、失望和绝望都会随之而来。但当在这些情况下重新激活给予时，这些否认的品质将被驱散，内识将再次以非常具体的方式开始表达它自身。</p><p>Therefore, upon the hour remind yourself of this great truth, and in your deeper meditations allow yourself to experience Knowledge. Allow yourself to receive it. Give yourself to this application of your mind and your body. In this, Knowledge will give itself, and you will be fulfilled because you have given life the greatest gift that can be given.</p><p>因此，每到整点提醒你自己这个伟大的真理，并在你更深层次的冥想中允许你自己体验内识。允许你自己接收它，给予你自己的身心投入到这个应用中。在此过程中，内识将给予它自身，而你也会因为向生命给予了最伟大的礼物而感到满足。</p><p>Practice 242: Two 30-minute practice periods. Hourly practice. </p><p>练习 242 ：两个 30 分钟的练习时段。每小时练习。</p>]]></content>

      <title>第二百四十一阶：我的愤怒是没有正当理由的</title>
      <link href="/2024/11/24/241/"/>
      <url>/2024/11/24/241/</url>
      
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="STEP-241-MY-ANGER-IS-UNJUSTIFIED"><a href="#STEP-241-MY-ANGER-IS-UNJUSTIFIED" class="headerlink" title="STEP 241 MY ANGER IS UNJUSTIFIED."></a>STEP 241 MY ANGER IS UNJUSTIFIED.</h2><p>Anger is unjustified, for anger alone is merely your response to your failure to apply Knowledge. This engenders anger at its very source. But this need not happen, because anger is a response. As a response it can generate anger in others and stimulate a violent response internally and externally wherever it is applied. Knowledge, however, will redirect anger so that it has no destructive qualities, for what you wish to express is that which fortifies Knowledge in others. It is the strength of your conviction and not your desire to hurt yourself or others that is the true efficacy of the emotion that is the core of anger. Thus, it may be said that your anger is a true communication that has been distorted by your own projections of blame and fear. Once these distortions have been cleared away, the true communication that is the seed of all anger can be expressed. This can only bring about good. </p><p>愤怒是没有正当理由的，因为愤怒本身只是你未能运用内识时的一种反应。这种反应会使愤怒在其源头上产生。但这种情况并非不可避免，因为愤怒是一种反应。作为一种反应，它能引起他人的愤怒，并在任何地方引起内部和外部的暴力反应。然而，内识会重新引导愤怒，使其不具备破坏性，因为你希望表达的是能够强化他人内识的沟通。而愤怒的核心情感的真实效力来自于你信念的力量，它不是你想伤害你自己或他人的欲望。因此，可以说，愤怒是你内心的真实沟通，但它被你自身的指责和恐惧的投射所扭曲。一旦这些扭曲被清除，愤怒中蕴含的真实沟通将得以表达。而这种表达只会带来好的结果。</p><p>Anger, then, is not justified, for it is a misinterpretation of a true communication. Your anger is not justified because anger is born of confusion. Yet confusion calls for preparation and the true application of Knowledge. Therefore, the sinful are not punished but are attended to. The wicked are not sent to hell but are prepared for Heaven. This is the true nature of God’s purpose in the world. That is why God can never be angry, because God is not offended. God is merely applying God to a situation where God has temporarily been forgotten. </p><p>因此，愤怒是没有正当理由的，因为它是对真实沟通的误解。你的愤怒是没有正当理由的，因为愤怒源于困惑。然而，困惑需要准备和内识的真实应用。因此，罪人不会被惩罚，而是被照料；恶人不会被送入地狱，而是为进入天堂做好准备。这就是上帝在这个世界上的目的的真实自然。这就是为什么上帝永远不会生气，因为上帝并没有被冒犯。上帝只是在暂时忘记上帝的情况下应用上帝。</p><p>In the greater scope of things, even the separation of all individual minds is a very temporary occurrence. You cannot think yet at this level and will not be able to do so for a long time, for you must undergo the various stages of development that integrate your mind into greater and greater experiences of relationship and life. But as you proceed and as you take each vital step that expands your horizons, you will begin to understand that anger is unjustified. It merely represents a failure to apply Knowledge in a particular situation. This calls for remedy not for condemnation. Here you will realize that your anger is something to be understood. It is not to be rejected, for if you reject anger, you also reject the seed of anger, which is true communication. Therefore, We wish to clean away that which has spoiled your true communication so that your true communication may shine forth, for true communication always comes from Knowledge.</p><p>在更伟大的范围内，甚至所有个体心灵的分离也是一种非常短暂的现象。你尚未能够在这个层面上思考，而且在很长一段时间内也无法做到，因为你必须经历各个发展的阶段，将你的心灵融入更大、更深的关系与生命的体验中。但随着你的进步，随着你迈出每一个扩展视野的重要步骤，你将开始理解愤怒是没有正当理由的。它仅仅代表了在特定情况下未能应用内识的表现。这需要的是补救而非谴责。在这里，你会认识到你的愤怒是需要被理解的，而不是被拒绝的，因为如果你拒绝愤怒，你也会拒绝愤怒的种子——即真实的沟通。因此，我们希望清除那些污染了你真实沟通的事物，使你的真实的沟通能够焕发光芒，因为真实的沟通总是源于内识。</p><p>Think of this idea upon the hour. In your deeper practice periods, actively engage your mind in looking at every single thing that you are angry about, from very tiny things that are specific to things in general that upset or discourage you. Remind yourself as you review your inventory of anger that your anger is unjustified. Remind yourself that it calls for the application of Knowledge and that within each angry experience or feeling that you have, there is a seed which is true. Therefore, your anger need not be rejected but cleansed, for in cleansing your anger you will be able to communicate that which you intended to communicate in the beginning where you initially failed. Then your self-expression will be complete, and anger will be no more.</p><p>每隔一小时就思考这个想法。在深入练习时，积极调动你的心灵，审视你所愤怒的每一件事，从非常微小的具体事情到让你沮丧或气馁的一般事情。在回顾你的愤怒清单时，提醒你自己你的愤怒是没有正当理由的。提醒你自己，它需要运用内识，在你每一次愤怒的经历或感受中，都有一颗真实的种子。因此，你的愤怒不需要被拒绝，而是被净化，因为在净化你的愤怒时，你将能够传达你一开始想要传达的沟通，而这正是你最初失败的地方。这样，你的自我表达就会完整，愤怒也就不复存在了。</p><p>Practice 241: Two 30-minute practice periods. Hourly practice.</p><p>练习 241 ：两次 30 分钟的练习时段。每小时练习。</p>]]></content>

Ideas alone can set you on your way, but they cannot take you on the journey. They may speak of greater things awaiting you, but they cannot take you there, for Knowledge must be your guide to your destiny and your fulfillment. With ideas you stand at the beginning, pointing the way for others, but you yourself cannot go. </p><p>伟大的想法、奇妙的形象或美好的信仰体系无法满足你对内识的需求。仅靠想法可以为你指引道路，但它们无法带你踏上旅程。它们可能会谈论等待你的更伟大事物，但它们无法带你到达那里，因为内识必须成为你通向天命和成就的指引者。有了想法，你站在起点，为他人指明方向，但你自己却无法前行。</p><p>When you are traveling with Knowledge, Knowledge will extend itself through ideas. It will extend itself through actions, through gestures and through all the vehicles of communication in this world. Therefore, do not be content with ideas alone. Do not think that by speculating upon ideas that you are comprehending the nature of Knowledge and its true application in the world. These things can be experienced and observed, but the individuals experiencing and observing them must be moved at the very core of their being. </p><p>当你与内识同行时，内识将通过想法延伸它自身。它将通过行动、通过姿态以及通过这个世界中所有的沟通载体来扩展它自身。因此，不要满足于仅仅拥有想法。不要认为通过推测想法，你就能理解内识的自然以及内识在世界中的真实应用。这些事物可以被体验和观察，但体验和观察它们的人必须从他们存在的核心被推动。</p><p>Therefore, do not be satisfied with little things in place of the greatness of your true being and your purpose in the world. Return to Knowledge, and be grateful for the ideas that have pointed you in this direction. But realize that the power that can move you, the power that gives you the strength to prepare and participate, is born of the great Wisdom and Knowledge that you carry. It requires Knowledge to follow Knowledge. It requires Knowledge to prepare for Knowledge. Thus, Knowledge is exercised even as you approach it. </p><p>因此，不要用小事代替你真实存在的伟大和你在世界中的目的。回归内识，感激那些将你指引到这个方向的想法。但要意识到，能推动你的力量，能赋予你准备和参与的力量，来自于你所携带的伟大智慧和内识。追随内识需要内识。准备迎接内识也需要内识。因此，即使在你接近它时，内识也在被运用。</p><p>Do not, then, remain at the beginning of your journey with ideas alone. Do not accept little things in place of the greatness of your function. Remind yourself of this upon the hour and in your deeper meditation practices, once again enter stillness and peace. Come to your practice without questions. Come to your practice without petitions. Remind yourself that in Knowledge all things will be given, all things will be received and all things will be applied as they are needed. As your mind becomes more simple and open, it will become a vehicle for Knowledge to express itself in the world.</p><p>因此，不要仅停留在旅程的起点，仅凭想法前行。不要用小事来代替你的伟大运作。每小时提醒你自己这一点，并在更深入的冥想练习中，再次进入静止与和平状态。没有疑问的来到你的练习中。没有请求的来到你的练习中。提醒你自己，在内识中，一切都会被赋予，一切都会被接纳，一切都会根据需求而得到应用。随着你的心灵变得更加简单和开放，它将成为内识在世界中表达它自身的载体。</p><p>Practice 240: Two 30-minute practice periods.

Freedom is yours who can dedicate yourself to your one purpose and to your specific tasks that emanate from this purpose. What greater freedom is there than the freedom to utilize your Knowledge and to fulfill its destiny in the world? Nothing else can be called freedom, for anything else is merely the freedom to be in chaos and to degenerate into misery. </p><p>与内识同在，自由属于你。自由属于你，你不必为不必要的思考和猜测而承受不必要的负担。自由属于你，你可以专注于你的唯一目的，以及由这个目的所产生的具体任务。还有什么比善用你的内识并在世界上完成其天命的自由更大的呢？其他任何事物都不能称之为自由，因为其他任何事物都只是陷入混乱和堕落痛苦的自由。</p><p>You are free this day to allow Knowledge to abide with you. This day in your hourly practice and in your two deeper meditations, remember that you are free. When you have the freedom to be with Knowledge in your two meditation periods, allow yourself to enter stillness and let not any feeling, idea or thought dissuade you from experiencing the great freedom that you have to escape from the world into Knowledge. </p><p>今天你是自由的，让内识与你同在。今天，在你每小时练习和两次更深入的冥想练习中，记住你是自由的。当你在两次冥想中拥有与内识同在的自由时，允许你自己进入静止，不让任何情感、思想或念头使你偏离，去体验你所拥有的伟大自由，让你从这个世界中逃离，进入内识的自由。</p><p>These practice times are so important for your overall well-being. The result of this involvement will give you greater access to Knowledge in all of your outward endeavors as you learn to abide in peace with Knowledge and as you learn to follow Knowledge as it exercises its Wisdom in the world.

I am part of a Greater Force for good, and I am a beginning student of Knowledge. I am grateful for the gift that has been given, which I am now beginning to comprehend. In complete faithfulness and devotion, I will continue my practice today so that I may appreciate the value of my own life.”</p><p>“我被派往这个世界，为我的精神家庭服务，我的精神家庭服务于这个世界和物质宇宙中的所有世界。我是更伟大的善的力量的一部分，我是内识的初学者。我对这份礼物心存感激，现在我已开始理解这份礼物。今天，我将以完全忠实和虔诚的态度继续我的实践，以便我能够体会到我自己生命的价值。</p><p>Following this invocation begin your long review. Begin with the first lesson of the two-week period, review the instructions and your practice, and then proceed on day by day. When you have completed your Review, once again repeat the invocation for today and then spend several minutes in silence. In this period of stillness begin to feel the power of what you are undertaking. The power of Knowledge and the grace that it bestows upon the world is what you will be learning to receive and to express in the days and weeks to come.</p><p>致词结束后，开始长篇回顾。从两周的第一课开始，回顾指导和你的练习，然后一天一天地进行。完成回顾后，再次重复今天的祈祷文，然后静默几分钟。在这段静止的时间里，开始感受你正在做的事情的力量。内识的力量和它赐予世界的恩典，就是你在接下来的几天和几周里要学习接收和表达的。</p><p>Practice 238: One long practice period.</p><p>练习 238 ： 一段漫长的练习期</p>]]></content>

      <title>第二百三十七阶：我只是开始理解我生命的意义</title>
      <link href="/2024/11/17/237/"/>
      <url>/2024/11/17/237/</url>
      
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="STEP-237-I-AM-ONLY-BEGINNING-TO-COMPREHEND-THE-MEANING-OF-MY-LIFE"><a href="#STEP-237-I-AM-ONLY-BEGINNING-TO-COMPREHEND-THE-MEANING-OF-MY-LIFE" class="headerlink" title="STEP 237 I AM ONLY BEGINNING TO COMPREHEND THE MEANING OF MY LIFE."></a>STEP 237 I AM ONLY BEGINNING TO COMPREHEND THE MEANING OF MY LIFE.</h2><p>You are only beginning to comprehend the meaning of your life. This will naturally arise in  your understanding without your efforts in attempting to conceptualize it. The meaning and purpose of your life will simply arise and be expressed today and tomorrow and in the days to come, for Knowledge is that simple and fundamental. Thus, your intellect can be used to deal with the physical necessities of your life, the particulars of your life and the mechanism of your life, for this is the application of the intellect. Yet the greatness of Knowledge provides purpose, meaning and direction, which the intellect can never provide. Therefore, the intellect is a faculty that has a true function here, for it serves the greatness of Knowledge. </p><p>你只是刚刚开始理解你生命的意义。这将自然地在你的理解中出现，而不是通过你的努力去概念化它。你生命的意义和目的将自然而然地在今天、明天以及未来的日子里显现，因为内识是如此简单而根本。因此，你的智力可以用来处理你生命中的物质需求、生命的细节以及生命的机制，因为这就是智力的应用。然而，内识的伟大提供了目的、意义和方向，这些是智力永远无法提供的。因此，智力在这里有一种真实的功能，因为它服务于内识的伟大。</p><p>You are only beginning to comprehend the meaning of Knowledge and the nature of Knowledge. Think not that your conclusions thus far are adequate to your needs, for you are a beginning student of Knowledge and as a beginning student, you will not make the mistake of relying upon your assumptions alone. For beginning students make few assumptions and are eager to learn all that is necessary for them. Be a beginning student today. Recognize how little you know and how much you must learn. You have a lifetime to learn this, and yet your lifetime must be activated and strengthened beyond what you have realized thus far. In time, the greatness that you carry will express itself through you in actions both great and small.</p><p>你只是开始理解内识的意义和内识的自然。不要认为你迄今为止的结论就足够满足你的需求，因为你是内识的初学者，作为初学者，你不能仅仅依赖于你的假设。因为初学者不会做出太多的假设，而是渴望学习所有对他们来说必要的事情。今天就做一名初学者。认识到你知道的如此之少，以及你必须学习的是如此之多。你有一生的时间来学习这一切，但你的生命必须超越你迄今为止所意识到的，得到激活和增强。随着时间的推移，你所携带的伟大将通过你的小事和大事表现出来。</p><p>Today, in your deeper practice periods where you enter stillness, allow your awareness of Knowledge to be cultivated further. Attend to your practice like a patient gardener who does not demand that all plants bear fruit today, but who understands the seasons of growth and change. Allow yourself to have this comprehension, for in time you will understand objectively how human beings develop and grow and what they carry within them. When you leave this world, if you are successful in cultivating Knowledge and in allowing it to give all of its gifts into the world, you will then be able to become one of the Teachers of those who remain behind. In this way, you will fulfill your learning in the world by contributing all that you have acquired in the world to others. In this, your gift is fulfilled and theirs is furthered. </p><p>今天，在你进入静止状态的深入练习阶段，允许你进一步培养对内识的觉知。像一位耐心的园丁一样，照顾你的练习，不要求今天所有的植物都结出果实，但理解成长和变化的季节。允许你自己拥有这种理解，因为随着时间的推移，你将客观地理解人类是如何发展和成长的，以及他们内心中携带的内识。当你离开这个世界时，如果你成功地培养了内识，并允许内识将所有的礼物带入世界，那你将能够成为那些留下来的人们的老师之一。这样，你将在世界上通过将你所获得的一切贡献给他人，来完成你在世界上的学习。在这一点上，你的礼物得以圆满，他们的礼物也得到了进一步的扩展。</p><p>You are only beginning to comprehend these words. Today strengthen your experience of Knowledge so that the comprehension of these words may deepen within you. Upon the hour repeat today’s idea so that all of your activities and all of your engagements, in whatever environment you find yourself, are conducive to your practice. For there is no event or interaction which Knowledge cannot bless and harmonize.</p><p>你只是开始理解这些话语。今天，加强你对内识的体验，以便这些话语的理解能够在你内心加深。每小时重复今天的想法，使你的一切活动和参与，不论你身处何种环境，都有助于你的练习。因为没有任何事件或参与是内识无法祝福并使其和谐的。</p><p>Practice 237: Two 30-minute practice periods. Hourly practice. </p><p>练习 237 ： 两个 30 分钟的练习时段。每小时练习。</p>]]></content>

      <link href="/2024/11/17/236/"/>
      <url>/2024/11/17/236/</url>
      
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="STEP-236-WITH-KNOWLEDGE-I-WILL-KNOW-WHAT-TO-DO"><a href="#STEP-236-WITH-KNOWLEDGE-I-WILL-KNOW-WHAT-TO-DO" class="headerlink" title="STEP 236 WITH KNOWLEDGE I WILL KNOW WHAT TO DO."></a>STEP 236 WITH KNOWLEDGE I WILL KNOW WHAT TO DO.</h2><p>With Knowledge you will know what to do, and your certainty will be so strong that it will be difficult for you to doubt it or to argue against it. Here you must be prepared to act and act boldly. If your predominant concern is protecting your ideas and your physical body, then you will be afraid of Knowledge, fearing that it will lead you to do something that will be dangerous or harmful for you. Knowledge can only be demonstrated. Its beneficence must be experienced. It can only be experienced by accepting its presence and carrying out its direction. </p><p>有了内识，你会知道该做什么，你的确定性将如此强烈，以至于你很难对此产生怀疑或提出异议。在这里，你必须准备好行动，并且大胆地行动。如果你主要关心的是保护你的想法和你的身体，那你就会害怕内识，担心它会引导你去做一些对你来说危险或有害的事情。内识只能通过体验来展示。它的恩惠必须通过体验才能感受到。只有接受它的存在并执行它的指引，才能体验到它。</p><p>With Knowledge you will know what to do, and your certainty will far exceed all of the pretenses you have made about certainty thus far. Self-doubt may continue in the face of Knowledge, but Knowledge is so much greater because your whole being will be engaged in the activity. Only the littleness of your self-doubt, born of your own false beliefs, can argue against it. Yet its arguments are pathetic and pitiful and lack depth and conviction. </p><p>有了内识，你将知道该做什么，而你的确定性将远远超越你迄今为止关于确定性的所有伪装。尽管面对内识时，内心的自我怀疑可能会继续存在，但内识的伟大超越了这一切，因为你的整个存在都会参与到这项活动中。只有源于你自己错误信念的渺小的自我怀疑，才会对此提出质疑。然而，这些质疑是可怜且微不足道的，缺乏深度和信服力。</p><p>Knowledge will move within you at certain times, for in stillness it observes all things until it is ready to act, and when it acts, it acts! Thus it is that you will learn with Knowledge to be at peace in the world, and yet when you act, you will act with true efficacy and with great result. In this way, you may be a person of action and contemplation all at once, for your contemplation will be deep and meaningful, and your action will be deep and meaningful as well. </p><p>内识会在某些时候在你内心运作，因为在静止中它观察一切，直到准备好行动，而一旦它行动，就会付诸行动。因此，你将在内识的引导下学习在世界上保持和平，而当你采取行动时，你的行动将真实有效，并取得伟大的成果。通过这种方式，你可以同时成为一个行动者和沉思者，因为你的沉思将是深刻而有意义的，你的行动也将是深刻而有意义的。</p><p>With Knowledge you will know what to do. Do not think that you know what to do unless you are with Knowledge and Knowledge is indicating for you to do something with great power. Do not make small attempts at resolving your problems, for without Knowledge your attempts will be meaningless and will compound your frustration.</p><p>有了内识，你将知道该做什么。不要认为你知道该做什么，除非你与内识同在，并且内识正以伟大的力量指示你去做某些事情。不要做一些小尝试来解决你的问题，因为没有内识的指引，你的尝试将毫无意义，并且会加重你的挫败感。</p><p>Upon the hour repeat today’s idea and consider it. In the depth of your longer practices, utilize the skills that you have cultivated thus far to engage yourself with stillness. If Knowledge is still, you may be still as well. Thus, when Knowledge stimulates action, you will be able to act, and in so doing, the resolution that you bring will be greater than anything you could conceive of.</p><p>每小时重复今天的想法并思考它。在更长时间的练习中，运用你迄今为止培养的技能，使你自己进入静止状态。如果内识是静止的，你也可以是静止的。这样，当内识激发行动时，你将能够采取行动，而在此过程中，你所带来的解决方案将超越你所能想象的一切。</p><p>Practice 236: Two 30-minute practice periods. Hourly practice. </p><p>练习 236：两个 30 分钟的练习时段。每小时练习。</p>]]></content>

Yet it is far simpler and more subtle than that which you can yet comprehend. It can be seen in the innocence of a child’s eyes; it can be imagined in the greatness of the movement of galaxies. In the simplest gesture or the greatest act, it can manifest itself. </p><p>你需要一些时间才能认识到内识的力量，因为它比你所能想象的任何事物都要伟大。然而，它比你目前所能理解的更简单、更微妙。它可以在孩子眼中的天真中被看到；它可以在银河系伟大运动的想象中被感知。无论是最简单的姿态还是最伟大的行为，它都能显现出来。</p><p>Allow yourself to accept that you are only beginning to realize the presence of Knowledge in your life and in all life. This is determined by your capacity for Knowledge, which, along with your desire for Knowledge, you are now cultivating. That is why day after day you practice stillness and peace and only interrupt these practices with practicing the active engagement of your mind for great purposes. Here you are building your capacity as well as your desire, for each day you must practice because of the desire for Knowledge, and each practice develops your capability to experience Knowledge. </p><p>允许你自己接受这样的事实，即你才刚刚开始意识到内识就存在于你的生命和所有生命中。这取决于你的内识能力，以及你对内识的渴望。这就是为什么你日复一日地练习静止与和平，只是在实践这些练习时，才会为了伟大的目的而积极调动你的心灵。在这里，你不仅培养了你的能力，也培养了你的渴望，因为每一天你都必须练习，因为你渴望内识，而每一次练习都培养了你体验内识的能力。</p><p>You are beginning to recognize the presence of Knowledge, the power of Knowledge and the evidence of Knowledge. Remind yourself of this upon the hour and do not forget. Once again, in the depth of your longer practice periods, give yourself completely to entering stillness and peace, for this will undo all blame and unforgiveness within you and will show you the power of Knowledge, which you are now learning to accept.</p><p>你开始认识到内识的存在、内识的力量和内识的证据。时刻提醒你自己，不要忘记。再次，在你较长时间的深度练习中，给予你自己完全进入静止与和平，因为这将消除你内心所有的责备与不原谅，并向你展示内识的力量，你现在正在学习接受内识的力量。</p><p>Practice 235: Two 30-minute practice periods. Hourly practice. </p><p>练习 235 ：两个 30 分钟的练习时段。每小时练习。</p>]]></content>

It directs all manner of individual pursuits that are for the benefit of humanity. In the arts, in the sciences, in all endeavors, in the simplest gesture and the greatest act, Knowledge demonstrates a greater life and strengthens all of the highest qualities in individuals who are engaged with it. </p><p>内识激发所有心理和生理的能力，使之为善。它引导所有旨在造福人类的个人追求。无论是在艺术、科学，还是所有其他努力中，无论是最简单的举止还是最伟大的行动，内识都展示了更伟大的生命，并增强了所有参与其中的个体的最高品质。</p><p>Because Knowledge is great, you do not need to associate it only with great things, for the expression of Knowledge can permeate even the smallest word and the tiniest gesture. Thus, they too can have the greatest impact upon others. The power of Knowledge within one individual is to activate the power of Knowledge in other individuals and thus stimulate and support the regeneration of life within minds that are living in separate fantasies. Within the world you cannot see the overall potency of this, but you can experience it within your own life and see it demonstrated within the context of the relationships with which you are now engaged.</p><p>因为内识是伟大的，所以你不必仅仅将它与伟大的事物联系在一起，因为内识的表达可以渗透到每一个微小的字词和每一个细微的举动中。因此，它们也可以对他人产生最大的影响。个人的内识力量，激发了其他个人内在的内识力量，从而刺激并支持生活在分离幻想中的心灵的再生。在这个世界上，你无法看到这一切的整体效力，但你可以在你自己的生命中体验它，并在你与他人的关系中看到它的展现。</p><p>Do not think you know. You either do or you do not. Remember this, for the opportunity for self-deception is still with you because you have not yet been willing to face yourself completely, fearing that what you would find would discourage or destroy you. Yet when you face yourself completely, all you will find is Knowledge.</p><p>不要认为你知道。你要么知道，要么不知道。记住这一点，因为自我欺骗的机会仍然存在，因为你尚未完全面对你自己，害怕你会发现的内识会让你沮丧或摧毁你。然而，当你完全面对你自己时，你会发现的只有内识。</p><p>In your deeper practice periods today allow yourself to enter stillness once again, utilizing the methods that you have learned thus far. Do not allow anything to distract you from your purpose. You are part of a Greater Force, and this Greater Force is supporting you.</p><p>在今天更深入的练习期间，再次允许你自己进入静止，善用你迄今为止学到的方法。不要让任何事物分散你的注意力。你是更伟大力量的一部分，而这个更伟大力量正在支持着你。</p><p>Practice 234: Two 30-minute practice periods.</p><p>练习 234 ：两个 30 分钟的练习时段</p>]]></content>

      <link href="/2024/11/17/233/"/>
      <url>/2024/11/17/233/</url>
      
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="STEP-233-I-AM-PART-OF-A-GREATER-FORCE-FOR-GOOD-IN-THE-WORLD"><a href="#STEP-233-I-AM-PART-OF-A-GREATER-FORCE-FOR-GOOD-IN-THE-WORLD" class="headerlink" title="STEP 233 I AM PART OF A GREATER FORCE FOR GOOD IN THE WORLD."></a>STEP 233 I AM PART OF A GREATER FORCE FOR GOOD IN THE WORLD.</h2><p>This statement is absolutely true, though from a separated point of view it may be very difficult to understand. It is not expected that you will understand today’s idea, but it is given you to experience its power and potency, for being representative of truth it can lead you to the truth, which is the experience of Knowledge. This is the greatest possibility for any idea—that it can be a doorway to Knowledge. </p><p>这句话是绝对正确的，尽管从分离的角度来看，它可能很难理解。我们并不指望你能理解今天的观点，但我们希望你能体验到它的力量和效力，因为作为真理的代表，它能引领你走向真理，也就是内识的体验。这是任何想法的最大可能性——它可以是通向内识的入口。</p><p>This idea, then, must be approached properly. You must realize the limitations of a separated point of view and not attempt to judge the value of this day’s idea. You cannot judge it. You can only respond to it or deny it because its truth is greater than your current interpretation. Recognizing your current limitations in this regard gives you access to greatness, for without protecting that which weakens you, you may find your way to that which strengthens you and gives you purpose, meaning and direction. </p><p>因此，必须正确对待这个想法。你必须意识到分离观点的局限性，不要试图评判今天这个想法的价值。你无法评判它。你只能回应它或否定它，因为它的真理比你当前的解释更伟大。认识到你目前在这方面的局限性，你就能通向伟大，因为如果你不再保护那些削弱你的事物，你就可以找到能让你变得强大、赋予你目的、意义和方向的内识。</p><p>You are part of a Greater Force for good, for this force is joined and directed by Knowledge. Knowledge here is beyond what any individual can own. Therefore, there is no “your” knowledge and “my” knowledge; there is only Knowledge. There is only your interpretation and my interpretation, and in this there can be discrepancies, but Knowledge is Knowledge. It leads people together; it takes people apart. If it is truly comprehended from stillness and objectivity, its true direction can be discerned and followed.</p><p>你是一股更伟大善的力量的一部分，因为这股力量是由内识联合和引导的。这里的内识是任何个人都无法拥有的。因此，这里没有“你的”内识和“我的”内识；这里只有内识。只有你的解释和我的解释，其中可能存在差异，但内识就是内识。它引导人们相聚，也让人们分开。如果能从静止和客观的角度真正理解它，就能辨别和遵循它的真实方向。</p><p>Take strength today as you repeat this idea upon the hour. Know that all of your efforts on behalf of Knowledge are supplemented by those who practice with you—those whom you can see and those whom you cannot see. In your deeper practices allow your own self-discipline, which prepares you to enter into stillness and peace, to be supplemented as well. Thus, your accomplishment today will supplement the efforts of all others who practice, those who are unlearning the false and those who are learning the true along with you.</p><p>今天，当你每小时重复这个想法时，请从中汲取力量。要知道，你为内识所做的一切努力都会得到那些与你一起实践的人的补充——那些你能看见的人和那些你看不见的存在。在你更深层次的练习中，让你自己的自律也得到补充，它为你进入静止与和平做好了准备。因此，你今天的成就将补充所有其他练习者的努力，那些正在学习错误的人和那些与你一起学习真理的人。</p><p>Practice 233: Two 30-minute practice periods.

      <title>第二百三十二阶：我在生命中的召唤，需要他人的发展。</title>
      <link href="/2024/11/17/232/"/>
      <url>/2024/11/17/232/</url>
      
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="STEP-232-MY-CALLING-IN-LIFE-REQUIRES-THE-DEVELOPMENT-OF-OTHERS"><a href="#STEP-232-MY-CALLING-IN-LIFE-REQUIRES-THE-DEVELOPMENT-OF-OTHERS" class="headerlink" title="STEP 232 MY CALLING IN LIFE REQUIRES THE DEVELOPMENT OF OTHERS."></a>STEP 232 MY CALLING IN LIFE REQUIRES THE DEVELOPMENT OF OTHERS.</h2><p>For your calling to emerge in your life, it is not merely your own development that is essential, but the development of others with whom you will be directly engaged. Because your purpose in life involves your engagement with others, it is not a singular pursuit. It is not an individual fulfillment. In reality, there is no individual who is completely separate from other individuals because individuality has meaning only in terms of expressing that which binds and joins all life. </p><p>要让你的召唤在你的生命中显现出来，关键不仅在于你自身的发展，还在于你与他人直接互动时他们的发展。因为你生命中的目的涉及到与他人的互动，它不是一个孤立的追求，也不是单纯的个人成就。实际上，没有任何个体是完全独立于其他个体的，因为个体性只有在表达连接和联合所有生命的力量时才具有意义。</p><p>Therefore, this day develop the wisdom and the understanding that your true accomplishment is dependent upon the accomplishment of others as well. Think not that you know who all these others are, for you have not met them all yet. Some are in this world, and some are beyond the world. They may not be in your personal sphere at all.</p><p>因此，在今天，培养智慧和理解，认识到你的真实成就也依赖于他人的成就。不要认为你知道所有这些人是谁，因为你并未与他们全部相遇。有些人在这个世界上，有些则在世界之外。他们可能根本不在你的个人范围之内。</p><p>How, then, can you proceed when your accomplishment is partially dependent upon others? You proceed by giving yourself to your preparation. The power of doing this will strengthen those with whom you will be engaged in your life’s calling. Because your application strengthens one another, you are already in relationship; you are already influencing one another. The closer you come to that point where Knowledge emerges, the closer they will come as well. The more you hold yourself back, the more you hold them back. You cannot see the mechanism for this while you are in the world, for you must be beyond the world to see how this works. But you can understand the idea that all minds influence each other, particularly those minds that are meant to be engaged specifically with one another in life. </p><p>因此，当你的成就部分取决于他人时，你该如何前进呢？你可以通过全身心地投入到你自己的准备中来前进。这样做的力量将增强那些与你共同承担生命召唤的人的力量。因为你们的应用会增强彼此的力量，你们实际上已经处于关系之中了，你们已经在互相影响。你越接近内识的显现，他们也会越接近。而你越是拖延你自己，也会阻碍他们。你在这个世界时无法看到这种机制，因为你必须超越这个世界才能看到它是如何运作的。但你可以理解这样一个理念，即所有的心灵都会相互影响，特别是那些注定在生命中彼此互动的心灵。</p><p>Therefore, your advancement is dependent upon your own efforts and the efforts of others. Yet the efforts of others are supplemented and strengthened by your own efforts. Therefore, your achievement is very much given to you to accomplish, and yet your achievement will join you with life and will deepen the content and experience of relationship beyond what you were formerly able to experience.</p><p>因此，你的进步依赖于你自己的努力以及他人的努力。然而，他人的努力会因为你的努力而得到补充和增强。因此，你的成就是给予你去实现的，而你的成就也会使你与生命联结，并加深你对关系的内容和体验，超越你以前所能体验到的。</p><p>In your hourly remembrances and in your longer meditations in stillness today, allow your efforts to supplement the efforts of others, which will supplement your efforts. Allow the combination of your mutual dedication, then, to be a source of strength which you will experience this day and which will be experienced by those whom you have not yet met in this life.</p><p>在你每小时的铭记中，在你今天长时间的静思冥想中，让你的努力去补充他人的努力，而他人的努力也将补充你的努力。让你们相互的奉献结合起来，成为你今天将体验的力量源泉，也成为那些你在今生尚未遇见的人们将共同体验的力量之源。</p><p>Practice 232: Two 30-minute practice periods. Hourly practice. </p><p>练习 232 ：两个 30 分钟的练习时段，每小时练习。</p>]]></content>

      <title>第二百三十一阶：我在这个世界上有一个召唤</title>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="STEP-231-I-HAVE-A-CALLING-IN-THIS-WORLD"><a href="#STEP-231-I-HAVE-A-CALLING-IN-THIS-WORLD" class="headerlink" title="STEP 231 I HAVE A CALLING IN THIS WORLD."></a>STEP 231 I HAVE A CALLING IN THIS WORLD.</h2><p>You have a calling in this world. It is not what you think it is. It will emerge from your Knowledge once  Knowledge is allowed to emerge within your mind. You have a calling in this world because you have come here to do some very specific things. Your purpose in this world is to reclaim your Knowledge and to allow your Knowledge to express itself. That is a very simple statement of your purpose, but it is a statement that contains a great deal of depth and a great deal that must be fulfilled in time. </p><p>你在这个世界上有一个召唤。它不是你认为的那样。一旦内识被允许在你的心灵中出现，召唤就会从你的内识中浮现出来。你在这个世界上有一个召唤，因为你来到这里是为了做一些非常具体的事情。你在这个世界上的目的就是重新找回你的内识，允许你的内识表达它自己。这是对你目的的一个非常简单的陈述，但这个陈述包含了一种伟大的深度，需要在时间的流逝中去完成。</p><p>You have a calling in this world because you were sent here to do something. It is for this reason that your mind is the way it is and that you have a specific nature that is distinct from others. As your calling emerges, you will realize why you think and act the way you do, and all of this will be brought into true balance and harmony. This will erase all cause you have for selfcondemnation, for your nature represents a usefulness that you have not yet realized. In other words, you are made specifically for something that you have not yet comprehended. Prior to this, you will resist your nature, thinking it is a limitation upon you. In time, you will realize that it is an invaluable resource for accomplishment, for you have a calling in the world.</p><p>你在这个世界上有一个召唤，因为你被派遣来到这里做这件事。正因为如此，你的心灵才会是现在的样子，并且你有一种与他人不同的独特自然。随着你的召唤逐渐显现，你就会意识到为什么你会以这样的方式思考和行动，所有这一切都将达到真实的平衡与和谐。这将消除你所有自我谴责的理由，因为你的自然代表着一种尚未被你意识到的有用性。换句话说，你是专门为你尚未理解的内识而生的。在此之前，你会抗拒你的自然，认为它是对你的限制。随着时间的推移，你会意识到这是你实现成就的无价资源，因为你在这个世界上有一个召唤。</p><p>Upon the hour remind yourself of this and remind yourself that you do not yet know what your calling is. Without presumptions, you will be in a position to discover the truth. In your deeper practice periods today enter stillness and silence once again, utilizing the word RAHN if you find that helpful. This is a day of preparation for you to realize your true calling in the world. It is a day given to Knowledge and a day that is taken away from false assumptions and self-deception. A day given to Knowledge brings you closer to realizing your calling, which will arise naturally without your presumptions once you and those with whom you must be engaged are prepared.</p><p>每小时提醒你自己这一点，并提醒你自己你还不知道你的召唤是什么。没有任何预设的想法，你将处于发现真理的位置。在今天更深层次的练习时段中，再次进入静止与沉默，如果你觉得有帮助，可以使用“RAHN”这个词。这是一个为你准备的日子，让你意识到你在世界上的真实召唤。今天是一个为内识而度过的日子，也是一个摆脱错误假设和自我欺骗的日子。一个为内识而度过的日子，会让你更接近发现你的召唤。一旦你和你必须与之交往的人做好了准备，你的召唤就会自然而然地出现，而无需妄自菲薄。</p><p>Practice 231: Two 30-minute practice periods. Hourly practice.</p><p>练习 231 ： 两个 30 分钟的练习时段。每小时练习。</p>]]></content>

Allow yourself to be confused so that you may recognize the true  path of reclamation. Is this idea confusing to you? It may be confusing because people will not accept their confusion. They will tell lies about it, saying they are certain when they are confused, projecting blame upon others to excuse themselves or projecting blame upon themselves to excuse others. All of this represents confusion. </p><p>你的痛苦源于困惑。允许你自己困惑，这样你才能认识到真实的恢复之路。这个想法让你困惑吗？它可能会让人感到困惑，因为人们不会接受他们的困惑。他们会说谎话，在困惑的时候说他们很确定，把责任推给他人来为他们自己开脱，或者把责任推给他们自己来为他人开脱。所有这些都代表着困惑。</p><p>When you realize that you are confused, then you can claim the means to regain your certainty. If you do not accept that you are confused, you will impose substitutes for certainty upon yourself and the world and thus remove yourself from the possibility of receiving your certainty. This is why you must realize that your confusion is the source of your suffering, and you must allow yourself to be confused to recognize your true predicament. Recognizing your true predicament, you will see the great need for Knowledge, and this will engender in you the dedication and the self-application that is necessary for you to receive that which is your inheritance. </p><p>当你意识到你的困惑时，你就可以要求重新获得确定性。如果你不接受你的困惑，你就会把确定性的替代品强加给你自己和世界，从而使你自己失去获得确定性的可能性。这就是为什么你必须意识到，你的困惑是你痛苦的根源，你必须允许你自己困惑，才能认识到你真实的困境。认识到你真实的困境，你就会看到对内识的伟大需求，这将使你产生奉献精神和自我应用，而这正是你获得传承所必需的。</p><p>Today repeat this idea upon the hour and do not forget to do so. In your two longer practice periods, engage your mind actively in attempting to understand the depth and the meaning of today’s idea. Recognize objectively all of the feelings and the thoughts that are in favor of it and all of the feelings and the thoughts that are opposed to it. Take special care to recognize any objection that you might have to today’s idea. Then recognize the power of this idea within your own mind. This will give you a recognition of today’s idea and its true meaning. This will also help enable you to realize objectively the current construction of your mind. This is all part of your education as a student of Knowledge. Give yourself to considering today’s idea and do not be complacent with simple answers and explanations, for today’s idea contains a gift you have not yet experienced. </p><p>今天，每小时都要重复这个想法，不要忘记这样做。在两次较长时间的练习中，要积极调动你的心灵，尝试理解今天这个想法的深度和意义。客观地认识所有赞成它的感觉和想法，以及所有反对它的感觉和想法。特别注意识别你可能对今天的想法提出的任何反对意见。然后在你自己的心灵中认识到这个想法的力量。这将使你认识到今天的想法及其真实的意义。这也有助于让你客观地认识到你当前的心灵结构。这都是你作为内识学生所接受的教育的一部分。全身心地去思考今天的想法，不要满足于简单的答案和解释，因为今天的想法包含着你尚未体验到的礼物。</p><p>Practice 230: Two 30-minute practice periods. Hourly practice.</p><p>练习 230 ：两个 30 分钟的练习时段。每小时练习。</p>]]></content>

      <title>第二百二十九阶：我不会责怪他人带给我的痛苦</title>
      <link href="/2024/11/11/229/"/>
      <url>/2024/11/11/229/</url>
      
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="STEP-229-I-WILL-NOT-BLAME-ANOTHER-FOR-MY-PAIN"><a href="#STEP-229-I-WILL-NOT-BLAME-ANOTHER-FOR-MY-PAIN" class="headerlink" title="STEP 229 I WILL NOT BLAME ANOTHER FOR MY PAIN."></a>STEP 229 I WILL NOT BLAME ANOTHER FOR MY PAIN.</h2><p>Today’s idea represents a tremendous shift in understanding. It must be born of Knowledge to have true effectiveness, however. Its meaning is not immediately apparent, for you will soon find that there are many circumstances in which others seem completely responsible for your pain. It will be very difficult, given your habitual thinking and the assumptions upon which you live, to deny that others are indeed the cause of your pain. This, however, is not how Knowledge views you, and you must learn not to view yourself in this way. </p><p>今天的想法代表了一种极大的理解转变。然而，它必须源自内识，才能真实的具备效力。它的意义并不会立刻显现，因为你很快就会发现，在许多情况下，似乎他人完全是你痛苦的根源。考虑到你惯有的思维方式和你生命所依赖的假设，要否定他人确实是你痛苦的原因，将会非常困难。然而，内识并不会这样看待你，而你必须学会不要以这种方式看待你自己。</p><p>Pain is always a decision that you make in response to any stimuli in your environment. The body will have physical pain if it is so stimulated, but that is merely a sensory response. It is not the true pain that hurts you. The pain that hurts you is the crown of thorns of your own ideas and assumptions, your own misgivings and misinformation and your own unforgiveness towards yourself and the world. This produces a pain both within your mind and upon your body as well. It is this pain We wish to alleviate this day.</p><p>痛苦总是你对周围环境中的任何刺激所做出的决定。身体在受到刺激时会感觉到生理上的疼痛，但这仅仅是感官的反应。这并不是真实伤害你的痛苦。真实伤害你的痛苦是你自己的想法和假设的荆棘冠冕，是你自己的疑虑和错误信息，以及你对你自己和世界的无法宽恕。这种痛苦既会在你的心灵中产生，也会反映在你的身体上。这正是我们今天希望减轻的痛苦。</p><p>Therefore, consider today’s idea as a form of remedy against pain. If another is the cause of your pain, you have no remedy except to attack or to change the other person. Even your attempt to change them for good will be a form of attack, for underneath your altruism will be hatred and resentment. Therefore, there is no remedy for pain if its cause is beyond you. But there is remedy for all pain because Knowledge is with you.</p><p>因此，把今天的想法看作是一种缓解痛苦的方法。如果他人是你痛苦的根源，那么除了攻击或改变他人之外，你别无他法。即使你试图为善而改变他们，这也是一种攻击，因为在你的利他主义背后隐藏着仇恨和怨恨。因此，如果痛苦的原因在你之外，那么就没有缓解痛苦的方法。但所有痛苦都可以被缓解，因为内识与你同在。</p><p>Therefore, all pain must be recognized as the result of your own decision. It must be recognized as the result of your own interpretation. You may feel that you have been wronged by another or by the world. This feeling is actually present in your mind, so it need not be denied, but you must look beyond it to its source and to the mechanism for its emergence. To do this, then, you must utilize your own faculties. This will give you great strength. You will be able to do this because Knowledge is with you and because with Knowledge you can do all things that Knowledge asks you to do.</p><p>因此，所有的痛苦都必须被视为你自己决定的结果。它必须被视为你自己诠释的结果。你可能觉得你被他人或世界伤害了。这种感觉实际上存在于你的心灵中，所以你不需要否认它，但你必须超越它，看清它的根源和它出现的机制。为此，你必须运用你自己的能力。这会赋予你伟大的力量。你能够做到这一点，因为内识与你同在，并且因为有了内识，你可以完成内识要求你做的一切。</p><p>Without condemnation, the world is so relieved that it can begin to recover itself. Therefore, upon the hour repeat this idea and consider its meaning. Go deeply within it to discover what it truly holds for you. In your longer practice periods, enter stillness and peace, for without condemnation upon the world and upon yourself, the mind is at peace already.</p><p>没有谴责，世界会得到极大的缓解，它可以开始自我恢复。因此，每小时重复这个想法，思考它的意义。深入其中，探索它对你真正意味着什么。在较长的练习时间里，进入静止与和平的状态，因为没有对世界和你自己进行谴责时，心灵就会处于和平之中。</p><p>Practice 229: Two 30-minute practice periods. Hourly practice.</p><p>练习 229：两个 30 分钟的练习时段。每小时练习。</p>]]></content>

      <title>第二百二十八阶：今天，我不会贫困</title>
      <link href="/2024/11/11/228/"/>
      <url>/2024/11/11/228/</url>
      
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="STEP-228-I-WILL-NOT-BE-POOR-TODAY"><a href="#STEP-228-I-WILL-NOT-BE-POOR-TODAY" class="headerlink" title="STEP 228 I WILL NOT BE POOR TODAY"></a>STEP 228 I WILL NOT BE POOR TODAY</h2><p>You need not be poor, for poverty is neither your heritage nor your true destiny. Do not be poor today,  for Knowledge is the great wealth, and once it is allowed to emerge within any mind, it begins to generate its presence naturally in the world. It begins to balance and harmonize the mind that is its vehicle, and it begins to give specifically to certain individuals in specific ways. This is the genius that is with you. How can you be poor with such a gift? Only your self-deprecating ideas and forms of behavior can engender poverty. </p><p>你不必贫困，因为贫困既不是你的传承，也不是你真实的天命。今天不要贫困，因为内识是伟大的财富，一旦允许它在任何心灵中出现，它就会开始在世界上自然地产生存在感。它开始平衡和协调作为其载体的心灵，并开始以特定的方式给予特定的个体。这就是与你同在的天赋。拥有这样的礼物，你怎么会贫困呢？只有你自我贬低的想法和行为方式才会导致贫困。</p><p>Therefore, today begin to look more deeply at those things that are forms of obstruction to you. Think of this upon the hour. In your two deeper practice periods, engage your mind actively in attempting to discern specific forms of selfdeception and self-obstruction. Do this without condemnation, but with the objectivity that is necessary to view yourself clearly. Do not be dismayed that there are many subtle forms of self-deception. They are merely slight variations upon very simple themes. Their seeming complexity and number are unimportant except that you recognize them. They are all born of fear and the attempt to offset fear by engaging in illusion and by attempting to engage others in supporting illusion. All ideas without Knowledge serve this purpose, either directly or indirectly. Yet real purpose is the great force behind ideas that are for true service, as it is the great force behind all forms of action and behavior that are for true service.</p><p>因此，今天开始更深入地审视那些阻碍你的事物。每小时思考一次。在你的两次深入练习中，积极调动你的心灵，尝试辨别自我欺骗和自我阻碍的具体形式。这样做时不要谴责，而是要客观地看清你自己。不要因为有许多微妙的自我欺骗形式而感到沮丧。它们只不过是在非常简单的主题上稍加变化而已。它们看似复杂，数量也不多，重要的是你能识别它们。它们都源于恐惧，源于人们试图通过参与幻觉和试图让他人支持幻觉来抵消恐惧。所有没有内识的想法都直接或间接地服务于这个目的。然而，真正的目的才是真实服务的想法背后的伟大力量，因为它才是真实服务的一切形式的行动和行为背后的伟大力量。</p><p>Today We will look at obstacles, but not with shame, guilt or anxiety. Look only to strengthen the presence and the application of Knowledge and only to prepare yourself to be a greater vehicle for Knowledge in the world. That is the purpose  of today’s practice. Therefore, practice with true intent. You are greater than the errors that you perceive, and they cannot deceive you if you look at them objectively.</p><p>今天，我们将审视障碍，但不是羞愧、内疚或焦虑。只为加强内识的存在和应用，只为让你自己做好准备，成为内识在世界上的更伟大载体。这就是今天练习的目的。因此，要带着真实的意图去练习。你比你感知到的错误更伟大，只要你客观地看待它们，它们就不会欺骗你。</p><p>Practice 228: Two 30-minute practice periods. Hourly practice.</p><p>练习 228： 两个 30 分钟的练习时段。每小时练习。</p>]]></content>

This requires a great deal of sorting out. It requires discovering the true and the false and, through this contrast, learning to separate the two. In time, you will realize the distinction between the true and the false and will not be deceived by the pretense the false can make in its imitation of the true. </p><p>初学者总是认为他们知道一些他们不知道的事情，他们也总是认为他们不知道一些他们知道的事情。这需要大量的整理与分辨。它要求你辨别真实与虚假，并通过这种对比，学会将两者区分开来。随着时间的推移，你会意识到真实与虚假的区别，不会被假象所欺骗，假象总是通过模仿真实来进行伪装。</p><p>Remind yourself upon the hour today not to think that you know. Thinking that you know is only a form of substitution. You either know or you don’t know. Your thinking here merely supports or denies that which you know. But thinking you know is thinking without Knowledge, which is always mindless and engenders confusion and self-doubt.</p><p>今天，每小时都要提醒你自己不要认为你知道。认为你知道只是一种替代的形式。你要么知道，要么不知道。你在这里的思考只是支持或否认你所知道的。但是，认为你知道是没有内识的思考，这种思考总是无意识的，会产生困惑和自我怀疑。</p><p>In your deeper practice periods today, do not be deceived by thinking that you know. Once again return to the pure experience of Knowledge itself. In stillness and in peace, totally give yourself to your practice today. Knowledge is an experience. It will engender its own ideas. It will stimulate and support those forms of behavior and those forms of selfapplication which are truly supportive of your true nature. Do not be content with things you think you know, for this is merely another form of denial which will leave you impoverished once again.</p><p>在今天的深入练习中，不要被你认为知道的想法所欺骗。再一次回到内识本身的纯粹体验中。在静止与和平中，完全投入到今天的练习中。内识是一种体验。它会孕育出它自己的想法。它将激发并支持那些真正有利于你真实自然的行为和自我应用方式。不要满足于你认为你知道的事情，因为这不过是另一种形式的否定，最终会让你再次陷入贫困。</p><p>Practice 227: Two 30-minute practice periods. Hourly practice.</p><p>练习 227 ：两个 30 分钟的练习时段。每小时练习。</p>]]></content>

In time, fear will become more and more external to your true experience as you learn to abide with Knowledge. The value of today’s idea must be recognized in light of the fact that your mind is engaged with fear habitually to such a great extent that it seems to make the reclamation of Knowledge and the application of Knowledge very difficult for you. This appears difficult only because your mind has been so habitually engaged with fear in the past. Habits can be broken. New habits of thinking and behavior can be instilled and strengthened. It is merely the result of applying your mind. It is the result of practice.</p><p>内识与你同在，当你与内识同在时，你就不会感到害怕。随着时间的推移，当你学会与内识同在时，恐惧会越来越多地成为你真实体验的外在表现。你必须认识到今天这个想法的价值，因为你的心灵习惯性地与恐惧纠缠在一起，以至于它似乎让你难以恢复内识和应用内识。这似乎很困难，只是因为你的心灵过去习惯性地与恐惧纠缠在一起。习惯是可以打破的。新的思维和行为习惯可以被培养和加强。它只是运用你心灵的结果。它是练习的结果。</p><p>Today practice abiding with Knowledge, which will undo all the habits that have cast themselves against you and the world. Being in life is practice and is always a form of service. Today practice the truth and serve the truth, and in this all errors are weakened. Their foundation is removed, and in its place you will begin to learn a new way of being in the world, a new way of engaging yourself with the world, and you will have a greater structure for applying your mental and physical faculties. </p><p>今天，练习与内识同在，这将消除所有曾经对你和世界构成障碍的习惯。生命的存在就是一种实践，并且永远是一种服务。今天，实践真理，为真理服务，在这个过程中，所有的错误都将被削弱。它们的根基被移除，取而代之的是，你将开始学习一种新的处世之道，一种新的与世界互动的方式，同时你也将拥有一种更为坚实的结构，以便更好地运用你的心理和生理能力。</p><p>Upon the hour abide with Knowledge. Dispel fear and remind yourself that Knowledge is with you. Remind yourself that your Teachers are with you. Remind yourself that students everywhere who are involved in the reclamation of Knowledge are with you. In this, the world will become small and you will become great. In your deeper practices, allow yourself the freedom of experiencing Knowledge. Enter the great depth and stillness of the mind, as it immerses itself into the presence of love.</p><p>每小时，练习与内识同在。驱散恐惧，提醒你自己，内识与你同在。提醒你自己，老师与你同在。提醒你自己，世界各地正在恢复内识的学生与你同在。在这个过程中，世界将变得渺小，而你将变得伟大。在更深入的实践中，允许你自己自由地体验内识。进入心灵的深度与静止，让它沉浸在爱的存在中。</p><p>Practice 226: Two 30-minute practice periods.

To take your life seriously is to receive its true grace, which will make you very happy. Therefore, you must be very serious with yourself as you are learning now to become a vehicle for Knowledge, and you may be very happy and lighthearted that Knowledge is with you. This, then, is the true application of your mind, for you are lighthearted with that which is lighthearted, and you are serious with that which is serious. A mind that is serious in its outward direction and lighthearted in its internal delight will be a mind that is fully integrated. This will be a mind where Heaven and Earth touch. </p><p>如果你能理解，今天给你的讯息并不矛盾。认真对待你的生命，就是接收它真实的恩典，它会让你非常快乐。因此，当你现在学习成为内识的载体时，你必须非常认真地对待你自己，你可能会因为内识与你同在而感到非常快乐和轻松。这才是你心灵的真实运用，因为你对轻松的事物感到轻松，对严肃的事物感到严肃。一颗对外严肃、对内轻松的心灵将是一颗完全融合的心灵。这将是一种天国与地球相接的心灵。</p><p>The grace that you will be receiving this day will engender happiness and true appreciation, yet the application it calls for will require your serious engagement, your sincere dedication and the genuine application of your mental and physical faculties. Here your strengths represent your happiness, and your happiness is strengthened by the application of your true abilities.</p><p>这一天，你会接收到恩典将会带来的快乐和真实的感激，然而，它所要求的应用将需要你认真地参与、真诚地奉献以及真正地应用你的心理和生理能力。在这里，你的力量代表着你的幸福，而你的幸福则因你真实能力的应用而得到加强。</p><p>Think of this upon the hour as you repeat your idea for today. As you attempt your deeper meditation practices, seriously engage your mind so that it may experience the lightheartedness and the great joy of Knowledge. In this, you will see that today’s idea is entirely uniform in its meaning. In this, you will not confuse that which is happy and that which is serious. This will give you a greater comprehension of the world.</p><p>每小时重复一次今天的想法。当你尝试更深层次的冥想练习时，请认真投入你的心灵，让心灵体验内识带来的轻松和伟大的喜悦。这样，你就会发现今天的想法在意义上是完全一致的。这样，你就不会混淆快乐和严肃。这会让你对世界有更伟大的理解。</p><p>Practice 225: Two 30-minute practice periods.

Imagine for a moment as you do this that you are looking through the eyes of your Teachers who are watching your life from far above. They are without condemnation. They are merely taking note of your strengths and weaknesses, strengthening the former and minimizing the effects of the latter. As you learn to view your life objectively, you will learn to see your life through the eyes of your Teachers. This is looking with Knowledge. This is looking without judgment. Given this, the mind becomes a vehicle for Knowledge, and Knowledge will bestow upon you all the ideas and the activities that are truly beneficial for you.</p><p>今天，通过回顾过去两周的练习来练习客观性。再次阅读每一天的课程，回忆那一天的练习。从两周期间的第一次练习开始，然后逐步跟随每一天。加强你客观观察自己进步的能力。看看在你练习强度较大的日子里和练习强度较小的日子里发生的事情。想象一下，当你这样做的时候，你正透过你老师的眼睛，他们正从遥远的上空注视着你的生命。他们没有谴责。他们只是注意到你的长处和短处，加强前者，尽量减少后者的影响。当你学会客观地看待你的生命时，你就会学会用老师的眼睛看待你的生命。这就是用内识看问题。这就是不带评判的观察。有了这些，心灵就会成为内识的载体，内识就会赋予你所有真正有益的想法和活动。</p><p>Allow your Review practice period today to be engaged on your own behalf. Utilize your mind purposefully and do not allow it to wander. Break the habit of thinking mindlessly. Break the habit of preoccupying yourself with foolish and meaningless things. Allow your Review today to demonstrate to you that you are a true student of Knowledge.</p><p>让今天的回顾练习为你自己服务。有目的地善用你的心灵，不要让它游离。改掉漫不经心思考的习惯。改掉一心扑在愚蠢无意义的事情上的习惯。让你今天的回顾向你证明，你是一名真实的内识学生。</p><p>Practice 224: One long practice period.</p><p>练习 224： 一段漫长的练习期</p>]]></content>

This judgment does not require anger, sadness, loss, resentment, hostility or revenge. It does not call for attack in any form. The world is confused. Judge it not. How can the world be certain when the world is without Knowledge? You may look upon your life thus far and realize the extent of your own confusion. How could it be otherwise when you were without Knowledge? Knowledge is with you now, as it was then. You are beginning to reclaim Knowledge so its certainty can express itself through you increasingly. This is the great gift that you are now learning to receive. It is a gift the world will learn to receive through you. </p><p>你能对这个世界做出的唯一评判就是世界是混乱的。这种判断不需要愤怒、悲伤、失落、怨恨、敌意或报复。它不需要任何形式的攻击。世界是混乱的。不要评判世界。当世界缺乏内识时，又怎能确定呢？回顾你迄今为止的生命，你可能会意识到你自己的迷茫程度。当你没有内识的时候，又怎么会不是这样呢？现在，内识与你同在，一如既往。你正开始重新找回内识，让内识的确定性越来越多地通过你表达出来。这是你现在正在学习接收的伟大礼物。这份礼物是世界将通过你学习接收的礼物。</p><p>Each hour as you look upon the world and all of its activities, judge it not, for it is merely confused. If you are in distress today, judge yourself not, for you are merely confused. In your deeper practice periods today, allow yourself to enter stillness. You enter stillness simply by wanting to enter stillness. It is a gift that you allow for yourself. To do this, you give yourself to receiving the gift. Here there is no giver and sender of the gift, for the gift reverberates between you and your Source. Knowledge and its vehicle merely affirm one another. </p><p>每时每刻，当你看到世界及其所有活动时，不要评判它，因为它只是混乱。如果你今天感到痛苦，也不要评判你自己，因为你只是困惑。在今天更深入的练习时段中，让你自己进入静止状态。你只要想进入静止状态，就能进入静止状态。这是你给你自己留出的礼物。要做到这一点，你要让你自己收到这份礼物。在这里，既没有给予者，也没有送礼者，因为礼物在你和你的源头之间回荡。内识及其载体只是相互确认。</p><p>The world is confused.

Do not view your confusion as something that endangers you or belittles you. Confusion here is merely a sign that you are realizing the limitations of your own ideas and assumptions. You must give these up to allow Knowledge to become apparent to you, for in the face of all important decisions that require your attention this day, Knowledge has already provided an answer. It is not an answer that you can find amongst the many answers that you provide for yourself or that you assume others provide for you.</p><p>不要把困惑视为失败。不要把你的困惑看作是对你的威胁或贬低。这里的困惑只是一个迹象，表明你意识到了你自己的想法和假设的局限性。你必须放弃这些，让内识向你显现，因为面对今天需要你关注的所有重要决定，内识已经给出了答案。这个答案不是你自己提供的，也不是你假设他人为你提供的。</p><p>Therefore, let all substitutes for Knowledge fade from you. Allow yourself to be confused, for in your genuine confusion Knowledge may arise naturally. This, then, represents your freedom, for in freedom you are free to be confused.</p><p>因此，让所有内识的替代品从你内心消失。允许你自己困惑，因为在你真正的困惑中，内识可能会自然产生。这代表着你的自由，因为在自由中，你可以自由地困惑。</p><p>Remind yourself of this idea upon the hour, and do not be complacent with simple explanations or assumptions about its great meaning for you.

Hold yourself back intentionally so that Knowledge may grow within you. This is no limitation that you place upon yourself. Instead, it is the meaningful use of your mind and strength to cultivate an awareness of the Greater Power within you and to allow it to emerge, to guide and to direct you.</p><p>克制那些你认为对内识的开垦有害或有损的能力。有意克制你自己，让内识在你内心深处成长。这不是你对你自己的限制。相反，这是有意义地使用你的心灵和力量，培养你对内心深处更伟大力量的觉知，并让它出现、引导和指引你。</p><p>In today’s lesson, as in lessons past, you are learning to recognize the source of Knowledge and the vehicle of Knowledge and not to confuse the two. Learn restraint today so that Knowledge may grow within you. Do not think that restraint merely refers to past behavior where you limited what was genuine within yourself. No, your focus today is to learn the form of intentional restraint that represents an expression of your power and self-discipline. Your power and self-discipline must now be exercised to become strong, for your mind and body are vehicles of Knowledge, and as vehicles, they must be developed and strengthened. </p><p>在今天的课程中，和过去的课程一样，你要学会认识内识的来源和内识的载体，不要混淆两者。今天，你要学会克制，让内识在你的内心深处成长。不要认为克制仅仅是指过去你限制你自己内心真实想法的行为。不，你今天的重点是学习有意克制的形式，它代表了你的力量和自律。你的力量和自律现在必须得到锻炼才能变得强大，因为你的心灵和身体是内识的载体，作为载体，它们必须得到发展和加强。</p><p>In your deeper practices today, as in your hourly practices, restrain those forms of thinking and behavior that betray your Knowledge so that you may enter Knowledge in stillness and in peace. With this restraint, freedom will be discovered, for freedom is found beyond this world and is brought into this world, for freedom is the gift of Knowledge.</p><p>在你今天的深入练习中，就像在你每小时的练习中一样，克制那些背叛你内识的思维和行为方式，这样你才能在静止和安宁中进入内识。有了这种克制，自由就会被发现，因为自由是在这个世界之外被发现的，也是被带入这个世界的，因为自由是内识的礼物。</p><p>Practice 220: Two 30-minute practice periods.

Your ambition is born of your personal need for recognition and reassurance. It is an attempt to counteract fear by controlling the opinions of others. Your ambition here is destructive, but like all other faculties of mind that are now misappropriated, in time it can serve the greatness of Knowledge. You have not achieved this state yet; therefore, do not attempt to do anything with your Knowledge, for it is not for you to use Knowledge but to receive Knowledge. It is in your receptivity to Knowledge that you will find Knowledge to be of the greatest service and usefulness to you.</p><p>随着内识在你内心深处开始萌芽，不要让你自己的野心欺骗你。你的野心源于个人对认可和保证的需求。这是试图通过控制他人的看法来抵消恐惧。这里的野心是破坏性的，但就像所有现在被挪用的心灵功能一样，随着时间的推移，它可以服务于内识的伟大。你还没有达到这个状态；因此，不要试图对内识做任何事情，因为你的任务不是使用内识，而是接收内识。你对内识的接收将使内识对你产生最大的帮助和效用。</p><p>Do not let ambition pull you where you cannot go. Do not let it misappropriate your vitality and your energy. Learn to become patient and calm with Knowledge, for Knowledge has its own goal and direction in life, which you are now learning to follow.</p><p>不要让野心将你拉向无法到达的地方。不要让野心挪用你的活力和能量。学会在内识面前保持耐心与平静，因为内识在生命中有它自己的目标和方向，而你现在正在学习跟随它。</p><p>Throughout today in your hourly practices and in your deeper meditations as well, allow yourself to be without ambition, for you do not know what to do with Knowledge. In your longer meditations, allow this to free you so that you may enter stillness and leave the world of physical things.</p><p>在你今天的每小时练习和更深层次的冥想中，允许你自己没有野心，因为你不知道该如何处理内识。在更长的冥想中，允许内识使你自由，以便你可以进入静止，离开物质世界的事情。</p><p>Practice 219: Two 30-minute practice periods.

Allow it to strengthen itself. Allow it to grow. It will give itself naturally, without your attempting to force its expression. In time, you will learn to become wise, both through the demonstration of Knowledge and through your own errors. You have already committed a sufficient number of errors to demonstrate all that We are telling you. </p><p>内识伴随着如何在世界上使用内识的智慧。因此，内识是你理解的源泉，而智慧则是学习如何在世界中有意义和建设性地应用内识。你尚未明智，因此今天请将内识保留在你自己的内心深处。让它自我增强，让它成长。内识会自然地表达它自己，而不需要你强迫它。在适当的时候，你将通过内识的展示和自身的错误来学习变得明智。你已经犯过足够多的错误，以证明我们告诉你的所有内容。</p><p>Keep Knowledge within yourself today so that it may grow strong within you. Allow yourself to extend its presence to only one or two individuals whom you recognize can appreciate it, for your awareness of Knowledge is still a tender shoot within you and cannot yet withstand the vicissitudes of this world. It has not grown strong enough in your own understanding to counteract the raging fear and hatred that sweep across the world. Knowledge can withstand this without difficulty, but you who are learning to become a recipient and a vehicle for Knowledge are not yet strong enough.</p><p>今天将内识保留在你的内心深处，让它在你的心中茁壮成长。只让你自己向你认识的、能够欣赏内识的少数一两个人展现它，因为你对内识的觉知仍然是你内心深处的一个脆弱的萌芽，尚未能够承受这个世界的种种变幻。它在你自身的理解中还不够强大，无法抵御席卷世界的恐惧和仇恨。内识能够轻松应对这一切，但你作为一个正在学习成为内识的接受者和载体的人，尚未足够强大。</p><p>Allow Knowledge to be kept within you today so that it may grow. Remind yourself of this upon the hour as you carry this jewel within your heart. In your deeper practice periods, which are times of freedom from limitation for you, allow yourself to return to your great love so that you may enter into true relationship with Knowledge. In time, all limitations to the expression of Knowledge will be lifted as you learn to wisely apply its communication in the world. But for now, keep Knowledge within your heart so that it may grow stronger and stronger.</p><p>今天，让内识保留在你的内心深处，以便它能成长。每当到整点时，提醒你自己，珍藏这颗心中的瑰宝。在你更深入的练习时段，这些是你摆脱限制的时间，让你自己回归于你伟大的爱中，以便你进入与内识的真实关系。随着时间的推移，所有对内识表达的限制将被解除，因为你将学会如何在世界上明智地应用它的交流。但现在，请将内识保留在你的内心深处，让它愈发强大。</p><p>Practice 218: Two 30-minute practice periods.

For every moment you spend in experiencing stillness or engaging your mind meaningfully, Knowledge becomes stronger and ever more present within you. You may wonder, “What is my gift to the world?” Your gift is what you receive here today.

This will generate greatness and humility all at once within you, for you will realize that you are not the source of your greatness, but the vehicle for its expression. This will keep you in true proportion and relationship to that which you serve. In relationship you receive all of the benefits of that which you claim to be your own. And yet with Knowledge you will not become self-aggrandized because you will realize your own limitations and the depth of your own need for Knowledge. With this understanding, you will realize and accept the source of life. With this, you will realize that you are in the world to serve Knowledge and that the world is meant to be the recipient of Knowledge. </p><p>你现在正在学习接受和尊重这种精神存在，随着时间推移，你就会意识到它对你和世界的重要性。这将在你的内心同时产生伟大和谦逊，因为你将意识到，你并不是伟大的来源，而是表达伟大的载体。这将使你与你所服务的对象保持真实的比例和关系。在这种关系中，你将获得所有你宣称属于你自己的恩惠。然而，有了内识，你就不会变得自我膨胀，因为你会意识到你自己的局限性以及你自己对内识的深度需求。有了这种理解，你将会意识到并接受生命的本源。有了这种理解，你将会意识到，你在这个世界上是为内识服务的，而这个世界注定是内识的承载者。</p><p>There is a Spiritual Presence in your life.

Realize, then, that you travel through life with great assistance, for your Teachers are with you to help you to realize and to cultivate Knowledge. </p><p>你的老师就在你身边，在幕后默默支持你。他们非常谨慎，不会对你施加太强烈的影响，因为你尚未具备完全接受和善用这种影响的能力。因此，要认识到你在生命的旅途中有伟大的援助，因为你的老师与你同在，帮助你认识内识和培养内识。</p><p>First, they must help you to realize your need for Knowledge, for your need for Knowledge must be fully established before you can engage in the reclamation of Knowledge. You must realize that without Knowledge life is hopeless, for you are without purpose, meaning and direction. Then only your errors can teach you, and only they can support your unforgiveness. </p><p>首先，他们必须帮助你意识到你对内识的需求。只有当你对内识的需求被完全确立后，你才能开始真正地恢复内识。你必须认识到，没有内识，生命是无望的，因为你没有目的、意义和方向。此时，只有你的错误才能教导你，也只有它们才能支持你的不宽恕。</p><p>Realizing the failure of your own ideas to be a substitute for Knowledge, you can then turn to Knowledge and become the happy recipient of its true gifts. Here all things that you have truly sought will be meaningfully satisfied. Here you will have a true foundation in life. Here Heaven and Earth will come together within you and all separation will end. Here you can accept the limitations of your physical existence and the greatness of your spiritual life. Turning to Knowledge, therefore, is of the greatest benefit for you.</p><p>当你认识到你自己的想法无法替代内识时，你才能转向内识，并愉悦地接受其真实的馈赠。在这里，你真正追求的一切都将得到有意义的满足。在这里，你将拥有真实的生命基础。在这里，天国与大地将在你内心汇聚，一切分离都将结束。你将在此接受你物质存在的局限，同时体悟到你精神生命的伟大。因此，转向内识对你来说是最大的福祉。</p><p>Remind yourself of this idea upon the hour, and in your two deeper practices today, enter stillness, using the word RAHN if it helps you. Be happy today that you can receive that which frees you.</p><p>每小时提醒自己这个想法，并在今天的两次深度练习中，进入静止状态。如果“RAHN”这个词对你有帮助，可以使用它。今天要感到喜悦，因为你能接受那使你获得自由的内识。</p><p>Practice 215: Two 30-minute practice periods.

It is simply a statement to liberate you from your own impediments. How can you possibly understand yourself if Knowledge is not revealing all things to you? How can you possibly understand the world when Knowledge is not revealing the world to you? This is pure experience, beyond all concepts and beliefs, for concepts and beliefs can only follow the experience and attempt to provide a structure where the experience can arise again. In no way can beliefs, assumptions or ideas possibly imitate Knowledge itself. </p><p>这并不是一种失败或限制的声明。它只是一种声明，旨在将你从你自己的障碍中解放出来。如果内识没有向你揭示一切，你又如何可能理解你自己呢？如果内识没有向你揭示世界，你又如何可能理解这个世界呢？这就是纯粹的体验，超越一切概念和信念，因为概念和信念只能跟随体验而来，并试图提供一个结构，使体验能够再次出现。然而，信念、假设或想法无论如何也无法模仿内识本身。</p><p>Of course you do not understand yourself or the world, for you only understand your ideas, and they are not eternal. Therefore, they cannot provide a solid foundation upon which you must learn to stand. Thus, they can only fail and deceive you if you rely upon them instead of Knowledge to reveal yourself and the world to you.</p><p>当然，你并不理解你自己或这个世界，因为你只能理解你的想法，而这些想法并不是永恒的。因此，它们无法为你提供必须学会站立的坚实基础。因此，如果你依赖于它们，而不是依赖内识向你揭示的你自己和世界，那它们只能使你失败并误导你。</p><p>Upon the hour remind yourself that you do not understand yourself. Free yourself from the burden of justifying your own judgments. Look upon yourself in your deeper meditation practices and remind yourself that you do not understand yourself. Now you are free to enter into stillness, for you are not attempting to use your experience to justify your fantasies about yourself. Here your mind becomes free to be itself, and you become free to appreciate yourself.</p><p>每个小时提醒你自己：你并不理解你自己。解放你自己，摆脱为你自己的判断辩护的负担。在你更深入的冥想练习中，看向你自己，并提醒你自己，你并不理解你自己。现在你可以自由地进入静止，因为你不再试图用你的经验来证明你对你自己的幻想是正确的。在这里，你的心灵可以自由地做回它自己，你也可以自由地欣赏你自己。</p><p>Practice 214: Two 30-minute practice periods.

You only entertain judgments about it and then attempt to  understand your judgments. The world will reveal itself to you as you look without these restraints and limitations. In this, you will find that your beliefs can become useful in allowing you to take each next step in life. They need not limit your perception of the universe. You cannot be in the world without beliefs or assumptions. Yet your beliefs and assumptions are meant to be tools to serve your mind, to give it a temporary structure and to allow it to engage its natural abilities in a positive manner. </p><p>你不理解这个世界。你只是对世界做出判断，然后试图理解你的判断。当你摒弃这些束缚和限制，世界就会展现在你面前。在这个过程中，你会发现你的信念会变得有用，让你在生命中迈出下一步。它们不必限制你对宇宙的感知。没有信念或假设，你就无法来到这个世界。然而，你的信念和假设是为你的心灵服务的工具，给心灵一个临时的结构，让它以积极的方式发挥它的自然能力。</p><p>You do not understand the world today. Be happy that this is so, for your condemnation is unfounded. You do not understand the world today. This gives you an opportunity to witness the world.</p><p>你并不理解当今的世界。你应该为此而感到高兴，因为你的谴责是毫无根据的。你不理解当今的世界。这给了你见证世界的机会。</p><p>Upon the hour repeat this idea as you look upon the world. Remind yourself that you do not understand what you see, so you are free to look again. If you are not free to look, it simply means that you are attempting to justify your own judgments.

In this, you cast your influence upon the world. In this, all others who seek to serve a true purpose cast their influence upon you. This counteracts the ignorant forces of the world. This counteracts the destructive forces in the world. This casts its influence on all minds to begin to awaken. </p><p>你确实会从与你共同练习的所有人身上获得力量，因为每一个努力与内识相结合的心灵，都会增强其他所有心灵的能力。通过这一点，你对世界施加了影响。在这一点上，所有寻求服务于真实目的的人也会对你施加影响。这抵消了世界上无知的力量。这抵消了世界上破坏性的力量。这对所有心灵施加影响，使它们开始醒来。</p><p>Receive faith from today’s idea, then, for faith it will give you as you realize that your own application is so greatly supplemented by the application of others. This will transcend any sense of inadequacy that you may have. This will help you overcome any sense of ambivalence regarding true preparation, for all other minds that are engaged in the reclamation of Knowledge are available to assist you here and now. </p><p>因此，接收今天的想法所带来的信心，因为当你意识到你自己所做的努力是多么得益于他人的努力时，这将给予你信心。这将超越你可能感受到的任何不足感。这将帮助你克服对真实准备的任何犹豫，因为所有参与内识恢复的心灵都在这里和现在为你提供帮助。</p><p>Thus, greatness is with you, the greatness of Knowledge and the greatness of all those who seek to reclaim Knowledge.

That is why humanity is seeking to enter into the Greater  Community because the Greater Community represents a broader range of its true relationships. You have true friends beyond the world because you are not alone in the world and you are not alone in the Greater Community of worlds. You have friends beyond this world because your Spiritual Family has its representatives everywhere. You have friends beyond this world because you are working not merely on the evolution of your world but on the evolution of the universe as well. Beyond your imagination, beyond your conceptual capabilities, this is most certainly true.</p><p>你在这个世界之外有伟大的朋友。这就是人类寻求进入大社区的原因，因为大社区代表着更广泛的真实关系。你在这个世界之外有真实的朋友，因为你在这个世界上并不孤单，在大社区的世界中也是如此。你拥有这个世界之外的朋友，因为你的精神家庭在世界各地都有代表。你有这个世界之外的朋友，因为你不仅致力于你世界的进化，也致力于宇宙的进化。超越你的想象，超越你的概念能力，这无疑是最真实的。</p><p>Feel, then, the greatness of the universe in which you live. Feel, then, the opportunity you have to serve the Greater Community of which your world is a part. You serve your great friends within the world and your friends beyond, for the work of Knowledge goes on everywhere. It is the attraction of God. It is the application of good. It is the force that redeems all separated minds and gives purpose, meaning and direction to the universe. Regardless of the mechanism of physical life, its value is determined by its origin and its destiny, both of which are beyond your comprehension. Realizing that Knowledge is the means that propels the world in its true direction, you can then value and receive that which gives your life purpose, meaning and direction.</p><p>因此，感受你所生活的宇宙的伟大。感受到你有机会为大社区服务，而你的世界就是大社区的一部分。你为世界上的伟大朋友服务，也为世界之外的朋友服务，因为内识的工作无处不在。这就是上帝的吸引力。它是善的应用。它是一种力量，能够救赎所有分离的心灵，并赋予宇宙以目的、意义和方向。无论物质生命的机制如何，其价值都是由其起源和天命决定的，而这两者都是你无法理解的。认识到内识是推动世界朝着真实方向发展的方式，你就能珍视并接受赋予你生命目的、意义和方向的内识。</p><p>Upon the hour today consider that you have friends beyond this world, both in other worlds and beyond the visible as well. Consider that you have this greater association. In your two deeper practice periods today, allow your mind to enter stillness so that such things may be experienced. Do not dwell upon them in your imagination, but allow instead for your mind to become still so that it may bestow Knowledge into your awareness and experience. You have friends beyond this world, and they are practicing with you today.</p><p>今天的每个整点，想想你在这个世界之外还有朋友，既有其他世界的，也有可见世界之外的。想想你有这种更伟大的联系。在今天的两次深度练习中，让你的心灵进入静止状态，从而体验这些关系。不要在想象中纠缠于此，而是让你的心灵变得静止，以便内识可以传递给你觉知和体验。你在这个世界之外有朋友，他们今天与你一起练习。</p><p>Practice 211: Two 30-minute practice periods.

They are but the outward expression of a mind that is serving Knowledge. Thus, they need not be forced upon oneself through arduous selfdiscipline. They arise naturally, for the mind serving Knowledge can only exemplify its own greatness and its own capabilities. What requires self-discipline is to reorient your focus, to reorient your devotion and to reorient your service. You either serve Knowledge or you serve the substitutes for Knowledge, for in all things you must serve. </p><p>在人类生活中最为珍视的一切——爱、耐心、奉献、宽容、宽恕、真实的成就感、勇气和信仰——都自然而然地源于内识，因为内识就是它们的源头。它们只是为内识服务的心灵的外在表现。因此，无需通过艰苦的自律来强迫自己。它们是自然而然产生的，因为为内识服务的心灵只能体现它自己的伟大和能力。需要自律的是重新定位你的注意力、重新定位你的奉献和重新定位你的服务。你要么为内识服务，要么为内识的替代品服务，因为在所有事情中，你都必须为内识服务。</p><p>Upon the hour repeat this idea to yourself so that you may consider it throughout the day. In your two deeper practice periods, engage your mind actively to consider the depth of this idea. You must think constructively here. Do not simply weave images for yourself that you find enjoyable. Do not simply make judgments that you find abrasive to yourself or others. Learn again through practice to become objective in applying your mind. Allow your mind to deepen its involvement.

All your failures are your own in this respect. This may look like a burden of blame at first, until you realize the greater opportunity that it presents to you. For if all failures are your own, then you will realize that all correction is given to you to apply. The failure of another is not your own, but your condemnation of it is your own failure. Therefore, any failure that engenders unforgiveness in you is your failure, for another’s failure need not engender unforgiveness in you or blame of any kind. In fact, the failures of others will engender your compassion and the application of Knowledge in the future and need not give rise to blame or unhappiness within you. </p><p>这个声明代表了你追求内识的意图，因为不原谅只是将责任施加在一个你无法理解或应用内识的情况上的表现。在这方面，你的所有失败都是你自己的。起初，这看起来像是责备的负担，直到你意识到它为你提供了更伟大的机会。因为如果所有的失败都是你自己的，你将意识到所有的纠正都是由你来应用的。另一个人的失败不是你的，但你对它的谴责却是你自己的失败。因此，任何在你心中引发不原谅的失败都是你的失败，因为另一个人的失败不需要在你心中引发不原谅或任何形式的指责。事实上，别人的失败会在未来激发你的同情心和内识的应用，而不需要在你心中引发指责或不快乐。</p><p>Knowledge is not shocked upon looking at the world. Knowledge is not dismayed. Knowledge is not discouraged. Knowledge is not affronted. Knowledge realizes the smallness of the world and the errors of the world. It realizes this because it only knows itself, and all that is not Knowledge is merely the opportunity for Knowledge to be reapplied. Thus, your unforgiveness is simply the opportunity for you to reapply Knowledge.</p><p>内识在看待世界时不会感到震惊。内识不会感到沮丧。内识不会感到失望。内识不会感到被冒犯。内识意识到世界的渺小和错误。它意识到这一点，因为内识只知道内识本身，而所有非内识的事物只是内识重新应用的机会。因此，你的不原谅仅仅是你重新应用内识的机会。</p><p>Repeat today’s idea upon the hour and do not underestimate its value to you who now seek to be unburdened from grief and misery. In your two deeper practice periods, think of those, one by one, for whom you feel unforgiveness— individuals that you have known personally and individuals that you have heard about or thought of, individuals that have been associated with failure. They will come to mind as you call upon them, for they are all waiting to be forgiven by you. Allow them now to arise one by one. As they do so, forgive yourself for failing to apply your Knowledge. Remind them as they appear to you that you are now learning to apply Knowledge and that you will not suffer on their behalf and they, therefore, need not suffer on yours. The commitment to forgive, then, is the commitment to realize Knowledge and to apply Knowledge, for Knowledge dispels unforgiveness like the light dispels the darkness. For there is only Knowledge and the need for Knowledge. That is all that you can possibly perceive in the universe. </p><p>在整点重复今天的想法，不要低估它对你这个寻求摆脱悲伤和痛苦的人的价值。在你两个更深的练习阶段，逐个想起那些你感到不原谅的人——你曾经认识的人和你听说过或想起的人，所有与失败有关的人。当你召唤他们时，他们会浮现在你的心灵中，因为他们都在等待你原谅他们。现在，让他们一个一个地出现。当他们出现时，原谅自己未能应用你的内识。提醒他们，当他们出现在你面前时，你正在学习应用内识，因此你不会因为他们而受苦，因此他们也不需要因为你而受苦。原谅的承诺就是意识到内识和应用内识的承诺，因为内识就像光明驱散黑暗一样驱散不原谅。因为在宇宙中只有内识和对内识的需求。这就是你所能感知的一切。</p><p>Your two practice periods are, therefore, dedicated to facing those whom you have accused and forgiving yourself for failing to apply Knowledge in your understanding of them and engagement with them. Do this without any form of guilt or self-deprecation, for how could you possibly not fail if Knowledge was not available to you or if you were not available to Knowledge. Accept, then, your former limitations and dedicate yourself now to perceiving the world anew, without blame and with the greatness of Knowledge.</p><p>因此，你的两个练习阶段专门用于面对那些你指责过的人，并原谅自己未能在理解和与他们的互动中应用内识。做到这一点时不要有任何形式的内疚或自贬，因为如果内识对你不可用，或你对内识不可用，你又怎么可能不失败呢。接受你以前的局限性，现在致力于以新的视角看待世界，不带责备，并怀有内识的伟大。</p><p>Practice 207: Two 30-minute practice periods. Hourly practice.</p><p>练习207：两个30分钟的练习阶段。每小时练习。</p>]]></content>

Without judgment, without illusion, without fantasy and without the limitations of a purely human viewpoint, you will see that love is flowing from you. You will see that all your frustration in life is your inability to experience and to express this love which wishes to flow from you. Regardless of the circumstances in which your frustration arises, it is always because you cannot express love. Your evaluation of difficulties and dilemmas can certainly conceal this fact but cannot deny its existence.</p><p>爱正在你心中流淌，今天，你可以尝试体验这一点，并释放那些阻碍它的东西。在没有评判、没有幻觉、没有幻想的情况下，以及不受纯粹人类视角的限制时，你会看到爱正在你心中流淌。你会发现，你在生命中遇到的所有挫折都是你无法体验和表达这种希望从你身上流淌出来的爱。无论你的挫折是在什么情况下产生的，它总是因为你无法表达爱。你对困难和困境的评估确实可能掩盖这个事实，但却无法否认它的存在。</p><p>Upon the hour allow love to flow from you, realizing that you do not need to engage in any form of behavior, for love will arise naturally from you like fragrance from a flower. In your deeper practices, allow your mind to become still so that love may flow from you. In this, you will realize the natural function of your mind and the greatness of Knowledge, which is within you but is not yours to own. </p><p>每小时都允许爱在你心中流淌，意识到你不需要参与任何形式的行为，因为爱会像花香一样从你身上自然产生。在你更深入的练习中，让心灵保持静止，以便爱能够在你心中流淌。在这个过程中，你将意识到心灵的自然功能以及内心的伟大内识，它们属于你，但不是你的所有物。</p><p>Do not let any self-deprecating ideas or self-doubts dissuade you from this opportunity today. Without your interference, love will flow naturally from you. You do not need to put on any pretense. You do not need to acquire any form of behavior for this to happen. Your behavior in time will represent that which flows from you naturally. Allow love to flow from you naturally today.</p><p>不要让任何自我贬低的想法或自我怀疑阻碍你今天的机会。没有你的干扰，爱将自然地在你心中流淌。你无需假装，也无需为了实现爱而去获取任何形式的行为。你的行为最终将表现出自然流淌的内识。今天，让爱自然地在你心中流淌。</p><p>Practice 206: Two 30-minute practice periods.

With blame the world becomes misunderstood, and your mind becomes a burden rather than an asset to you. Today’s idea requires practice, discipline and application, for your mind and all minds within the world have been misunderstood, misused and misdirected. Thus, you are now learning to utilize the mind positively by giving it a true function in service to Knowledge. </p><p>不要让你的心灵因将责备投射到世界上而贬低自己。伴随责备而来的是对世界的误解，你的心灵就会成为你的负担，而非你的资产。今天的想法需要实践、纪律和应用，因为你的心灵和世界上所有的心灵都被误解、误用和误导了。因此，你现在正在学习通过服务于内识来积极地运用心灵，赋予它为内识服务的真实功能。</p><p>Do not blame the world today. Do not judge the world today. Allow your mind to be still as you look upon it. Knowledge about the world arises gradually. It arises naturally. An idea may speak of it, but an idea cannot contain it. Knowledge represents an overall shift in your viewpoint, an overall change in your experience, an overall shift in your emphasis and an overall transformation of your value system. This is the evidence of Knowledge.</p><p>今天不要责备这个世界。今天不要评判这个世界。当你看待它时，让你的心灵保持安静。关于世界的内识是逐渐浮现的，是自然产生的。一个想法可以提到它，但想法无法包容它。内识代表了你视角的整体转变、你体验的整体转变、你重心的整体调整以及你价值体系的整体转变。这些就是内识的证据。</p><p>Do not blame the world today. It is blameless, for it is merely demonstrating that Knowledge is not being adhered to. What else can it do but commit error and folly? What else can it do but waste its great resources? Humanity can only be in error without Knowledge. It can only create fantasy. It can only engage in loss. Therefore, it does not deserve condemnation. It deserves the application of Knowledge. </p><p>今天不要责备这个世界。它是无可指责的，因为它只是在展示没有遵循内识的结果。除了犯错和愚行，它还能做什么？除了浪费巨大的资源，它还能做什么？没有内识，人类只能犯错，只能创造幻想，只能遭受损失。因此，它不应受到谴责，而应得到内识的应用。</p><p>Practice upon the hour not blaming the world. Do not let hours pass without your involvement. Give this day to serve the world in this way, for without your condemnation your love for the world will naturally arise and be expressed. In your two deeper practice periods, allow your mind to enter stillness. Without blame and judgment, stillness becomes accessible because it is natural. Without the imposition of your condemnation, your mind is allowed to be still. In stillness there is no blame or judgment. In stillness love will flow from you in all directions and will continue far beyond what you can perceive through your senses.</p><p>每小时练习一次，不责备这个世界。不要让时间在你的参与之外流逝。将这一天奉献于以这种方式服务世界，因为没有你的谴责，你对世界的爱将自然升起并表达出来。在你的两次深入练习中，让心灵进入静止。在没有责备和评判的情况下，静止变得可及，因为它是自然的。在没有谴责的干扰下，你的心灵得以安静。在静止中，没有责备或评判。在静止的状态下，爱会从你心中流向四面八方，并远远超出你的感官所能感知的范围。</p><p>Practice 205: Two 30-minute practice periods.

Let not your negative imagination conjure up images of loss and destruction. Let not your anxiety overtake your concentration on Knowledge. To objectively consider your world and the Greater Community in which you live should not incite fear but respect—respect for the power of the time in which you live and its importance for the future, respect for your own emerging abilities and their usefulness in the world that you perceive, respect for the greatness of the physical universe and respect for the power of Knowledge which is greater even than the universe that you perceive. </p><p>今天保持和平。不要让你的负面想象编织出损失与毁灭的景象。不要让焦虑分散你对内识的专注。客观地看待你所生活的世界以及所处的大社区，不应引发恐惧，而应引发尊重——对你所处时代的力量及其对未来的重要性的尊重，对你自身正在显现的能力及其在你所感知的世界中的作用的尊重，对物质宇宙的伟大的敬畏，以及对内识力量的尊重——一种甚至超越你所感知的宇宙的力量。</p><p>Remind yourself to be at peace upon the hour. Utilize your strength and your devotion for this. Give yourself to this. In your deeper meditation practices, using the RAHN word if necessary, allow your mind to become still so that it may enter into the greatness of Knowledge, which it is intended to serve. Be at peace today, for Knowledge is with you. Be at peace today, for you are learning to be with Knowledge.</p><p>每到整点时提醒自己保持和平。善用你的力量和奉献做到这一点。全身心投入其中。在你更深层次的冥想练习中，如有需要，使用RAHN这个词语，让你的心灵平静下来，进入内识的伟大境界——心灵本应服务的领域。今天保持和平，因为内识与你同在。今天保持和平，因为你正在学习如何与内识同行。</p><p>Practice 204: Two 30-minute practice periods.

      <title>第二百零三阶：大社区正在影响我所看到的世界</title>
      <link href="/2024/10/13/203/"/>
      <url>/2024/10/13/203/</url>
      
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="STEP-203-THE-GREATER-COMMUNITY-IS-INFLUENCING-THE-WORLD-I-SEE"><a href="#STEP-203-THE-GREATER-COMMUNITY-IS-INFLUENCING-THE-WORLD-I-SEE" class="headerlink" title="STEP 203 THE GREATER COMMUNITY IS INFLUENCING THE WORLD I SEE."></a>STEP 203 THE GREATER COMMUNITY IS INFLUENCING THE WORLD I SEE.</h2><p>If you can accept that your world is part of a Greater Community, which is simply obvious if you will look, then you must accept that the world is being influenced by the Greater Community, for the world is part of a Greater Community and cannot be independent of it. How the Greater Community is influencing your world is beyond your current ability to comprehend. But to understand that the world is being influenced allows you to view it from a greater perspective, which from a purely human viewpoint you would not be able to accomplish, for a purely human viewpoint does not allow for other intelligent life to exist. The absurdity of this point of view becomes quite evident as you begin to look at the universe objectively. This will inspire in you wonder, greater interest and caution as well. This is very important because the world is being influenced by the Greater Community, and you are part of the world that is being influenced.</p><p>如果你能接受你的世界是大社区的一部分，这一点只要你留意就会显而易见，那么你必须接受这个世界正在受到大社区的影响，因为这个世界是大社区的一部分，不可能独立于大社区。大社区如何影响你们的世界超出了你目前的理解能力。但理解到世界正在受到影响，可以让你从更广阔的视角看待它，而仅从纯粹的人类视角是无法做到的，因为这种视角不允许其他智能生命的存在。当你开始客观地看待宇宙时，这种观点的荒谬性就变得显而易见。这会激发你心中的好奇、更大的兴趣以及谨慎。这非常重要，因为世界正在受到大社区的影响，而你正是这个被影响世界的一部分。</p><p>As the physical world that you live in is being influenced by greater physical forces beyond your visual range, so the world mentally is being influenced by intelligent life that is engaged with your world. This intelligent life represents forces for good and forces for ignorance as well. In this, you must come to comprehend a fundamental truth: Weaker minds are influenced by stronger minds. This is true in your world and in all worlds. Beyond the physical, this does not hold true, but in physical life this is the case. That is why you are engaged now in making your mind strong and learning to respond to Knowledge, which represents the force for good everywhere in the universe. As you become stronger, you come to understand and comprehend more and more. Thus, your mind must be cultivated in Knowledge to become stronger so that it may serve a true cause.</p><p>正如你所生活的物理世界正受到你视野之外更大物理力量的影响一样，世界在心理上也正受到与你们的世界有接触的智能生命的影响。这些智能生命既代表了善的力量，也代表了无知的力量。在这一点上，你必须理解一个基本真理：较弱的心灵会受到较强心灵的影响。这在你的世界和所有世界中都是如此。在物质之外，这一原则并不适用，但在物质生命中却是如此。这就是为什么你现在需要致力于使你的心灵变得强大，并学习回应内识，因为内识代表了宇宙中普遍存在的善的力量。随着你变得更加强大，你将逐渐理解和领悟更多。因此，你的心灵必须在内识中得到培养，使其更为强大，从而为真实的事业服务。</p><p>Today, upon the hour, repeat the idea for the day and in your two deeper practice periods, attempt to concentrate on the words that We are giving you here. Use your mind actively. Do not allow it to stray and find refuge in meaningless or little things. Think of the greatness of these ideas, but do not consider them fearfully, for fear is not called for. What is called for is objectivity so that you may comprehend the greatness of your world, your universe and your opportunity within it.</p><p>今天，每小时重复一遍今天的想法，并在两个更深入的练习时段中，专注于我们在这里传达给你的话语。积极运用你的心灵，不要让它游离或沉迷于无意义的小事上。思考这些想法的伟大，但不要带着恐惧去思考，因为恐惧并非所需。所需的是客观性，以便你能够理解你所在的世界、宇宙以及你在其中机会的伟大。</p><p>Practice 203: Two 30-minute practice periods. Hourly practice.</p><p>练习 203：两个 30 分钟的练习时段。每小时练习。</p>]]></content>

Because you are on the surface of the world, preoccupied with human endeavors and limited by time and space, does not mean that you cannot behold the grandeur of the Greater Community. You may behold this by looking at the sky above and by looking at the world below. You may realize this by understanding the relationship of humanity to the universe at large and by realizing that humanity is but one more race evolving to develop its intelligence and its Knowledge so that it may find a true involvement as it emerges into the Greater Community. Looking in this way gives you a greater perspective. Looking in this way allows you to understand the nature of change in the world. Looking in this way allows you to have compassion for yourself and for other people, for compassion is born of Knowledge. Knowledge does not deprecate what is occurring but attempts to influence it for the good. </p><p>你可以见证大社区，因为你就生活在大社区之中。你生活在世界的表面，专注于人类的事业，受到时间和空间的限制，但这并不意味着你不能看到大社区的宏伟。你可以通过仰望头顶的天空和俯瞰脚下的世界来感知这一点。你可以通过理解人类与整个宇宙的关系，通过认识到人类只是一个正在发展其智能和内识的种族，以便在进入大社区时找到真实的参与，从而认识到人类与整个宇宙的关系。这样看，你就会有更大的视角。从这个视角看世界，你就能理解世界自然的变化。通过这种方式，你可以对自己和他人产生怜悯之心，因为怜悯之心源于内识。内识不会贬低正在发生的事情，而是试图影响它，使其向好的方向发展。</p><p>Upon the hour consider the value of today’s idea. Look out into the world and consider yourself a witness to the Greater Community. Think of your world as one of many, many worlds that are in a similar stage of evolution. Do not torment your mind by attempting to give form to that which is beyond the range of your perception. Allow yourself to live in a great and mysterious universe that you are only now beginning to understand. </p><p>每时每刻都要考虑今天想法的价值。放眼世界，将自己视为大社区的见证人。把你的世界看作是处于类似进化阶段的许许多多世界中的一个。不要试图赋予超出你感知范围的事物以形式，从而折磨你的心灵。让自己生活在一个伟大而神秘的宇宙中，你现在才刚刚开始理解它。</p><p>In your two deeper meditations, allow yourself to apply your mind actively in considering this idea. Try to look at your life from beyond a purely human perspective, for from a purely human perspective you will see only a human life, a human world and a human universe. You do not live in a human universe. You do not live in a human world. You do not live a purely human life. Understand that your humanity here is not denied but is given a greater inclusion in a greater life. Thus, your humanity becomes a source and a means of expression rather than a limitation that you impose upon yourself. Allow your deeper practice periods to become very active. Use your mind constructively. Use your mind objectively. Look at your ideas. Don’t simply be swayed by them. Look at your beliefs. Don’t simply follow or deny them. Learn this objectivity, and you will learn to see with Knowledge, for Knowledge looks on all things mental and physical with equanimity.</p><p>在你的两次更深层次的冥想中，让自己积极地运用你的心灵来思考这个想法。试着超越纯粹的人类视角来看待你的生命，因为从纯粹的人类视角来看，你只能看到人类的生活、人类的世界和人类的宇宙。你并不生活在人类的宇宙中。你不是生活在一个人类世界中。你过的不是一种纯粹的人类生命。你要理解，你的人性在这里并没有被剥夺，而是被赋予了更大的意义，融入了更伟大的生命之中。因此，你的人性将成为表达的来源和手段，而不是你强加给自己的限制。让你的深度练习变得非常活跃。建设性地使用你的心灵。客观地使用你的心灵。审视你的想法。不要简单地被它们左右。审视你的信念。不要简单地追随或否认它们。学会了这种客观性，你就学会了用内识看看待问题，因为内识会以平和的心态看待一切心理和生理的事物。</p><p>Practice 202: Two 30-minute practice periods.

Realizing this, you will understand the value of your body, and you will not deprecate it. For your mind and your body are but vehicles to express Knowledge. In this, you become the recipient of Knowledge. In this, you remember your great Heritage. In this, you are comforted by the assurance of your great destiny. </p><p>理解这一点，你会意识到心灵的价值，不再贬低它。理解这一点，你也会理解身体的价值，不再贬低它。因为你的心灵和身体只是表达内识的工具。通过它们，你成为内识的接收者。通过它们，你记起你的伟大传承。通过它们，你会因为对伟大天命的确认而感到安慰。</p><p>There is no illusion here. There is no self-deception here. Here all things find their right order. Here you understand the true proportion of all things. Here you understand the value of your mind, and you will not want to give it tasks of which it is not capable. Thus, your mind becomes constructively applied and will be unburdened with attempting the impossible. Realizing this, you will see that your body is made to serve your mind, and you will understand the value of your body and its great application as a tool for communication. In this, you will accept its limitations, for limited it must be. You will also appreciate its mechanism. You will appreciate all of the encounters that you have with other individuals in this world. You will be glad, then, that you have a mind and a body so that you may communicate the power and the essence of Knowledge.</p><p>这里没有幻觉，也没有自我欺骗。在这里，一切事物都找到它们应有的秩序。在这里，你理解所有事物的实际比例。在这里，你理解心灵的价值，因此不会让心灵承担超出其能力的任务。于是，你的心灵将得到建设性的应用，也就不会再为尝试不可能的事情而感到负担。认识到这一点，你会发现身体是为了服务心灵而存在的，你会理解身体的价值及其作为沟通工具的伟大应用。在这个过程中，你会接受身体的局限性，因为它必须是有限的。你也会欣赏它的机制。你会珍惜在这个世界上与你相遇的每一个人。于是，你会感到庆幸，自己拥有心灵和身体，可以用来传达内识的力量和精髓。</p><p>Repeat your idea for today upon the hour and consider it. In your two deeper meditation practices, allow your mind to become still so that it may learn to serve. You must relearn that which is natural to you, for you have learned the unnatural, which must now be unlearned. In its place the natural will be stimulated, for when the natural is stimulated, it becomes expressed. Then the mind re-engages with its true function, and all things find their true value.</p><p>每小时重复今天的想法并认真思考。在今天的两次深入冥想练习中，让心灵安静下来，好让它学会如何服务。你必须重新学习那些对你来说是自然的事情，因为你已经学会了不自然的行为，现在必须将其遗忘。取而代之的是自然会被唤醒，因为当自然被唤醒时，它就会得到表达。然后，心灵会重新与其真实的功能接轨，一切事物都会找到它们真实的价值。</p><p>Practice 201: Two 30-minute practice periods.

Your beliefs are too narrow, for Knowledge  is greater. Therefore, treat Knowledge with mystery and do not attempt to create a form for it, for it is greater than this and will exceed your expectations. Allow, then, for Knowledge to be mysterious so that it may yield its gifts to you without restraints. Allow your thinking and ideas to apply to the visible world that you see, for here your thinking can develop in a useful manner as you understand the mechanism of your physical life and of your involvement with others. Yet allow Knowledge to be beyond the mechanical application of your mind so that it may flow into each situation, bless it and give it purpose, meaning and direction.</p><p>你的感想过于渺小，因为内识是更伟大的。你的信念过于狭隘，因为内识是更伟大的。因此，要以神秘的态度对待内识，不要试图为它创造一种形式，因为内识比形式更伟大，它会超出你的期望。因此，请允许内识是神秘的，这样它就能无拘无束地向你提供它的礼物。让你的思维和想法适用于你所看到的可见世界，因为在这里，你的思维可以以一种有用的方式发展，因为你理解你的物质生命和与他人交往的机制。然而，允许内识超越你心灵的机械应用，让内识流入每一个情境，祝福心灵，赋予它目的、意义和方向。</p><p>Remind yourself of this idea upon the hour and consider it seriously in whatever situation you find yourself. In your two meditation practices today, allow yourself once again to enter stillness, using the RAHN practice if you find that helpful. Allow yourself to go beyond ideas.

      <title>第一百九十九阶：我所看到的世界正在进入大社区的世界</title>
      <link href="/2024/10/13/199/"/>
      <url>/2024/10/13/199/</url>
      
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="STEP-199-THE-WORLD-I-SEE-IS-EMERGING-INTO-THE-GREATER-COMMUNITY-OF-WORLDS"><a href="#STEP-199-THE-WORLD-I-SEE-IS-EMERGING-INTO-THE-GREATER-COMMUNITY-OF-WORLDS" class="headerlink" title="STEP 199 THE WORLD I SEE IS EMERGING INTO THE GREATER COMMUNITY OF WORLDS."></a>STEP 199 THE WORLD I SEE IS EMERGING INTO THE GREATER COMMUNITY OF WORLDS.</h2><p>Without the limitation of a purely human viewpoint, you will be able to see the evolution of your world in a greater context. Viewing the world without the distortion of your personal wishes and fears, you will be able to observe its greater movement and discern its overall direction. It is essential, then, that you realize the direction of your world because this is the context that gives meaning to your purpose and to your specific calling while you are here in this world. For you have come to serve the world in its present evolution, and your gifts are meant to serve it in its life to come.</p><p>没有纯粹的人类视角的限制，你将能够在更大的背景中看到你世界的进化。用不被个人愿望和恐惧扭曲的眼睛来看待世界，你将能够观察到它更大的运动，并辨别出它的整体方向。因此，认识到世界的方向是至关重要的，因为这是赋予你在此世界中的目的和特定召唤意义的背景。你来到这里是为了服务于当下世界的进化，而你的礼物正是为其未来的生命服务的。</p><p>Your world is preparing to enter into a Greater Community. The evidence of this is everywhere if you but look. Without belief or denial, things can simply be recognized. In this, life’s demonstration is obvious and need not be discerned from complexities. What makes life complex is that people want life to be what life is not, they want themselves to be what they are not and they want their destiny to be what it is not. Then they attempt to gain from life that which confirms their own idealism, and because life cannot confirm this, all becomes distressed, conflicted and complex. The mechanism of life may be complicated in its minute details, but the meaning of life is directly obvious to anyone who looks without the distortion of judgment or preference.</p><p>你们的世界正在准备进入大社区。这方面的证据无处不在，只要你留意观察。无需信仰或否认，事实可以被直接识别。在这方面，生命的展现是显而易见的，不需要通过复杂的方式来分辨。让生命变得复杂的原因在于，人们希望生命成为它并非的样子，他们希望自己成为他们并非的样子，并希望自己的天命是虚幻的。然后，他们试图从生命中获取能够印证他们理想主义的事物，但由于生命无法满足这些理想，一切变得困扰、冲突和复杂。生命的机制在细节上可能复杂，但生命的意义对于任何不带偏见或偏爱的观察者来说都是显而易见的。</p><p>Recognize that your world is preparing to emerge into the Greater Community. Do this without embellishing this recognition with your own imagination. You need not give form to the future. Only understand the present course of your world. In this, the meaning of your own inherent abilities and their future application will become ever more evident to you.</p><p>认识到你的世界正在准备进入大社区。要做到这一点，不要用自己的想象来美化这个认知。你不需要为未来赋予形式，只需理解当下世界的方向。在这个过程中，你自身固有能力的意义及其未来的应用将变得越来越明显。</p><p>Upon the hour repeat this statement and consider it seriously, for it is the absolute foundation of your life and it is necessary that you understand this. It is not mere belief; it is the evolution of the world. Within your two deeper meditation practices today, engage your mind actively in considering this idea. Look at your own beliefs that speak for or against this idea. Look at your own feelings about it. Examine yourself objectively as you attempt to engage with this powerful idea. This is a time for mental engagement. Utilize your practice periods with complete dedication and involve yourself completely. Allow your mind to penetrate the superficiality of its own surface ideas.</p><p>每小时重复这个声明并认真思考它，因为它是你生命的绝对基础，你需要理解这一点。这不仅仅是一种信念，而是世界的进化。在今天的两次更深层次的冥想练习中，积极地思考这个想法。审视你的信念，看它们是支持还是反对这个想法。看看你对此的感受。当你试图接触这个强大的想法时，客观地审视自己。现在是进行心理参与的时刻。完全投入你的练习期，专注其中。让你的心灵穿透自己表面想法的浅薄。</p><p>In Knowledge everything becomes still and quiet. Everything becomes known. Here you begin to discern the difference between knowing and thinking. You realize how thinking may only serve in the preparation for Knowledge, but that Knowledge far exceeds the range and grasp of any individual’s thinking. Here you will understand how the mind can serve your spiritual nature. Here you will understand the evolution of the world.</p><p>在内识中，一切都变得静止与安静。一切都被知晓。在这里，你开始区分知道和思考的不同。你会意识到思考只能为内识的准备服务，但内识远远超出了任何个人思考的范围和把握。在这里，你会理解心灵如何服务于你的精神自然。在这里，你会理解世界的进化。</p><p>Practice 199: Two 30-minute practice periods. Hourly practice.</p><p>练习199：两个30分钟的练习时段。每小时练习。</p>]]></content>

Follow the plan that is given to you. Do not hold yourself back or alter the instructions in any way. There are no shortcuts here; there is only the direct way. You are given the steps. Follow them. Be strong today. Only your ideas of yourself speak of weakness. Only your evaluation of yourself says that you are pathetic, incapable or inadequate. You must have faith in your strength and exercise this faith to realize your strength.</p><p>今天要坚强。遵循给你的计划。不要阻止自己，也不要以任何方式修改指示。这里没有捷径，只有直接的道路。你已经被给出了步骤。遵循它们。今天要坚强。只有你对自己的看法才是软弱。只有你对自己的评价才会说自己是可悲、无能或不足的。你必须对自己的力量充满信心，并运用这种信心来实现你的力量。</p><p>Upon the hour repeat this statement and attempt to experience it in whatever circumstance you find yourself. Within your two deeper practice periods today, use your strength to engage in stillness completely. Allow your mind to be freed of the chains of its own concepts. Allow your body to be freed of a tormented mind. In this, your mind and your body will settle into their natural function, and all things will fall into right order within you. Knowledge will then find expression through your mind and through your body. From this you will be able to bring into the world that which is greater than the world, and your life will be confirmed as a result.</p><p>每小时重复这个声明，并尝试在你身处的任何情况下体验它。在今天的两个更深入的练习时段中，运用你的力量完全进入静止状态。让你的心灵从它自己的概念枷锁中解脱出来。让你的身体从受折磨的心灵中解脱出来。在此过程中，你的心灵和身体将回归它们的自然功能，所有事物将在你的内心深处得到正确的秩序。然后，内识将通过你的心灵和身体找到表达的途径。由此，你将能够把比世界更伟大的内识带入这个世界，你的生命也将因此得到确认。</p><p>Practice 198: Two 30-minute practice periods. Hourly practice.</p><p>练习 198：两个 30 分钟的练习时段。每小时练习。</p>]]></content>

I will not think today that by a mere idea or assumption I can fully gain access to Knowledge itself. Realizing this, I will understand what is required of me and what I must give to my practices, for I must give of myself.</p><p>今天，我不会认为自己可以用智力来理解内识，也不会认为我可以将生命的伟大概念化。今天，我不会再认为，仅凭一个想法或假设，我就能完全获得内识本身。认识到这一点，我就会理解对我的要求是什么，我必须为我的实践付出什么，因为我必须给予我自己。</p><p>You must give of yourself. You cannot merely think of ideas and hope that they will answer your greatest need. Realizing this today, repeat your practice upon the hour and in your deeper meditations give yourself completely to the experience of Knowledge. Enter into stillness. Allow yourself to be completely involved. With this you will exercise the power of your own mind on your behalf. You will then realize that you have the power to dispel distractions; you have the power to dispel fear; you have the power to dispel obstructions because your will is to know Knowledge.</p><p>你必须给予自己。你不能只拥有想法，希望它们能满足你最大的需求。今天，意识到这一点，请在每一小时重复你的练习，在更深入的冥想练习中，将自己完全交给内识的体验。进入静止状态。让自己完全投入其中。这样，你就能代表自己行使心灵的力量。然后你就会意识到，你有力量驱散杂念；你有力量驱散恐惧；你有力量驱散障碍，因为你的意志知道内识。</p><p>Practice 197: Two 30-minute practice periods.

Read each day’s instructions and then review your experience of practice for that day. Begin with the first day in the two-week period, and follow each day step by step. You will now begin to review your preparation in two-week intervals. This is given you to do now because your perception and comprehension are beginning to bud and to grow. </p><p>今天回顾过去两周的准备工作。阅读每天的说明，然后回顾当天的练习经历。从两周内的第一天开始，每天按部就班。现在，你将开始以两周为间隔回顾你的准备工作。现在让你这样做，是因为你的感知力和理解力开始萌芽和成长。</p><p>Remember each day. Try to recall your practice and experience. The lessons themselves will recall this experience to you if you have forgotten. Try to see the progression of learning so that you may understand how to learn. Try to see that which confirms Knowledge and that which denies Knowledge within yourself so that you may learn to work with these tendencies. </p><p>记住每一天。试着回忆你的练习和经历。如果你忘记了，课程本身会让你回忆起这些经历。试着看清学习的进程，这样你就会理解如何学习。试着看清自己内心对内识的肯定和否定，从而学会与这些倾向合作。</p><p>Becoming a true student of Knowledge will require greater self-discipline, greater consistency of application and greater acceptance of worth than anything you have undertaken thus far. Following prepares you to become a leader, for all great leaders are great followers. If the source of your leadership represents goodness and truth, then you surely must learn to follow it. And to follow it, you must learn how to learn of it, how to receive it and how to give it.</p><p>要成为一名真实的内识学生，你需要比以往任何时候都更加自律、更加坚持不懈地运用内识、更加认同内识的价值。追随让你做好成为领导者的准备，因为所有伟大的领导者都是伟大的追随者。如果你的领导力来源代表着善良和真理，那你就必须学会追随它。为了追随它，你必须学会如何学习它、如何接收它以及如何给予它。</p><p>Let your long review time today, which may exceed two hours of involvement, be a review of the past two weeks, keeping all of these things in mind. Become objective about your life. There is no condemnation that is necessary here, for you are learning to learn, you are learning to follow and you are learning to employ Knowledge, as Knowledge will certainly employ you. Here Knowledge and you come together in true matrimony and in true harmony. Then Knowledge is more powerful, and you are more powerful. There is no inequality here, and all things find their natural course of expression.</p><p>今天的回顾时间可能会超过两个小时，让我们在回顾过去两周的工作时，牢记所有这些事情。客观地看待自己的生命。在这里，没有必要谴责，因为你正在学会学习，学会追随，学会运用内识，因为内识一定会运用你。在这里，内识和你是真实结合的，真实的和谐。内识更加强大，你也更加强大。这里没有不平等，万事万物都能找到自己自然的表达方式。</p><p>Use this Review to further and deepen your comprehension of your preparation, keeping in mind that understanding always comes in hindsight. This is a great truth in The Way of Knowledge.</p><p>使用这篇回顾进一步加深你对准备工作的理解，记住，理解总是在事后才会出现。这是内识之路中的伟大真理。</p><p>Practice 196: One long practice period.</p><p>练习 196： 一段漫长的练习期</p>]]></content>

It is also more wonderful than you realize. You are as yet afraid of it because of its great power. You are unsure if it will dominate you or control you, unsure of where it will take you and what you will have to do and unsure of what the result of all this will be. Yet as you go away from Knowledge, you re-enter confusion and the world of imagination. As you come closer to Knowledge, you enter certainty, confirmation and a world of reality and purpose. How can you know Knowledge from a distance? How can you determine its meaning without receiving its gifts?</p><p>内识比你意识到的更强大。它也比你意识到的更美妙。由于它的伟大力量，你目前仍然害怕它。你不确定它是否会支配你或控制你，不确定它会带你去往何处以及你必须做些什么，也不确定这一切的结果会是什么。然而，当你远离内识时，你重新进入了混乱和想象的世界。当你靠近内识时，你就进入了确定性、确认以及一个充满现实和目标的世界。你怎么能从远处知道内识呢？你怎么能在没有接受其馈赠的情况下确定它的意义呢？</p><p>Come close to Knowledge today. Allow it to silently abide within you, as you are learning to silently abide with it. Nothing could be more central to your natural experience than the experience of Knowledge. Be glad that it is greater than you realize, for your evaluation has been small. Be glad that you cannot understand it yet, for your understanding would only limit it and its usefulness to you. Allow the great to be with you so that your greatness may be demonstrated and experienced today.</p><p>今天靠近内识。让它静静地存在于你的内心深处，因为你正在学习与它默默相处。在你的自然经验中，没有什么比内识的体验更重要。庆幸它比你意识到的更伟大，因为你对它的评价还很渺小。庆幸你还无法理解它，因为你的理解只会限制它，限制它对你的作用。让伟大的内识与你同在，这样你的伟大今天也可以得到展现和体验。</p><p>Take this idea with you and practice it upon the hour. Keep it in mind throughout the day. In your two longer practice periods, allow yourself to experience the depth of Knowledge. Feel the power of Knowledge. Strengthen your resolve to do so. Dedicate your self-discipline, for here self-discipline is wisely employed. Knowledge is greater than you realize. Therefore, you must learn to receive its greatness.</p><p>今天带着这个想法，并在每个小时的练习中实践它。整天将其铭记于心。在你两个较长的练习时段中，允许自己体验内识的深度。感受内识的力量。增强你的决心。运用你的自律，因为在这里，自律得到了明智的运用。内识比你意识到的更伟大。因此，你必须学会接受它的伟大。</p><p>Practice 195: Two 30-minute practice periods. Hourly practice.</p><p>练习 195 ：两个 30 分钟的练习时段。每小时练习。</p>]]></content>

This necessity of action will give value and meaning to your activities and will affirm your worth in all of your engagements this day. Go where you are needed, where you need to go. Discern the actual motivation for this and distinguish it from any sense of guilt or obligation to others. Do not place artificial demands upon yourself. Do not allow others to place artificial demands upon you beyond your simple duties in this day. Go where you are truly needed. </p><p>让自己去需要你的地方，去你需要去的地方。这种行动的必要性将赋予你的活动价值和意义，并肯定你在今天所有活动中的价值。去需要你的地方，去你需要去的地方。找出这样做的真正动机，并将其与任何负罪感或对他人的义务区分开来。不要对自己提出人为的要求。不要让他人在你今天的简单职责之外对你提出人为的要求。去真正需要你的地方。</p><p>Remind yourself of this upon the hour, for its meaning must be penetrated to be experienced. If you are accustomed to guilt and obligation, today’s idea will seem to compound your difficulty. Yet today’s idea is really an affirmation of Knowledge within you, providing an opportunity for Knowledge to guide you and to demonstrate its value to you. It has nothing to do with dependence, for you must be independent of false things to follow that which is true. This is the value of all independence. </p><p>每时每刻都要提醒自己这一点，因为其意义必须深入体验。如果你习惯于内疚和义务，今天的想法似乎会加重你的困难。然而，今天的想法实际上是对你内识的肯定，为内识提供了一个引导你并向你展示其价值的机会。它与依赖无关，因为你必须独立于虚假的事物，才能追随真实的事物。这就是所有独立的价值所在。</p><p>In your longer practice periods, go deeply into Knowledge. And when you are in the world, keep this idea alive. Allow yourself to feel a deeper presence within you as you are out in the world of mundane things, as you are out in the world of small considerations. Greatness is here to serve the small. Remember.</p><p>在你较长的练习时间里，深入内识。当你在这个世界上的时候，要让这个想法保持活力。允许你自己感受到一种更深层次的存在，在你的内心深处，就像你在世俗的世界中一样，因为你在外面的世界要考虑的事情很少。伟大就在这里，为渺小服务。记住这一点。</p><p>Practice 194: Two 30-minute practice periods.

Knowledge will indicate if what they are saying is of  value or not. It will do this without any form of condemnation, without any comparison and without any evaluation on your part whatsoever. Knowledge is attracted to Knowledge, and it is not attracted to that which is not Knowledge. Therefore, you may find your rightful way without contributing judgment or hatred upon the world. This is your Inner Guidance system serving you. It will lead you where you need to be and will lead you to contribute where your contributions can be of the greatest value. If you listen to others without judgment, you will hear both Knowledge and the call for Knowledge. You will see where Knowledge exists and where it has been denied. This is natural. You do not need to judge people to make this determination. It is simply known.</p><p>今天，请不带评判地倾听他人。内识会指出他们所说的是否有价值。它不会对你进行任何形式的谴责，也不会对你进行任何比较和评价。内识会被内识所吸引，它不会被不是内识的关系所吸引。因此，你可以找到自己正确的道路，而无需对世界进行评判或仇恨。这是你的内在引导系统在为你服务。它将引领你到你需要去的地方，引领你到你能做出最大贡献的地方。如果你不带评判地倾听他人，你就会听到内识和对内识的呼唤。你会看到内识在哪里存在，又在哪里被剥夺。这很自然。你不需要评判他人来做出这个判断。它只是被简单地知道。</p><p>Listen to others so that you may experience yourself listening, for it is not your task to judge the world or to determine where and how your gifts should be given. It is your task to experience yourself in life and to allow Knowledge to arise, for Knowledge will give itself when and where it is appropriate. This allows you to have peace, for you are not trying to control the world.</p><p>倾听他人的声音，这样你才能体验到自己在倾听，因为你的任务不是评判世界，也不是决定在哪里以及如何给予你的礼物。你的任务是在生命中体验自己，让内识出现，因为内识会在适当的时候和适当的地方给予它自己。这让你拥有平静，因为你并不试图控制世界。</p><p>Allow your practices to be deep. Practice upon the hour as before. Listen to others today so that you may experience yourself in relationship with them, so that their true message to you may be given and comprehended. This will affirm for you the presence of Knowledge and the need for Knowledge in the world all at once.</p><p>让你的练习深入。像以前一样，在每一小时进行练习。今天，倾听他人的声音，这样你就能在与他人的关系中体验自己，从而获得并理解他们传达给你的真实讯息。这将同时肯定内识的存在以及世界对内识的需求。</p><p>Practice 193: Hourly practice.</p><p>练习 193： 每小时练习</p>]]></content>

Doing small things does not mean in any way that you are small. If you do not identify with your behavior and activities, you can allow your greatness to exist as you undertake them. Someone who is great can do small things without complaint. Someone who is with Knowledge can undertake mundane activities without any sense of disgrace. Activities are only activities. They do not constitute your true nature or being. Your true nature or being is the source of your life, which will express itself through your small activities as you learn to receive it and to see it in proper perspective.</p><p>今天不要忽视你需要做的小事。做小事并不意味着你是微不足道的。如果你不认同自己的行为和活动，你就能让自己的伟大在开展这些活动时得以体现。一个伟大的人可以毫无怨言地做小事。一个与内识同在的人可以毫无羞耻感地从事平凡的活动。活动只是活动，它们并不构成你的真实自然或存在。你的真实自然或存在是你生命的本源，当你学会接受它并以正确的视角看待它时，它就会通过你微小的活动表现出来。</p><p>Do not neglect small things. Care for small things so that your life in the world may be stable and may progress properly. Today, in your deeper practices, again enter the greatness and the depth of Knowledge. Because you have attended to small things, you can now spend this time of devotion and giving. In this way, your outer life is managed properly, and your inner life is attended to as well, for you are an intermediary between the life of greatness and life in the world. Thus, you attend to the small and you receive the great. This is your true function, for you are here to give Knowledge to the world. </p><p>不要忽视小事。关心小事，才能使你在这个世界上的生活稳定并正常发展。今天，在你的深入实践中，再次进入内识的伟大和深度。因为你已经照顾好了小事，所以你现在可以利用这段时间来奉献和给予。通过这种方式，你的外在生活得到了妥善管理，你的内在生活也得到了关注，因为你是伟大生命和世俗生活之间的中介。因此，你既关照小事，又接纳伟大。这就是你的真实职责，因为你来到这里是为了将内识带给这个世界。</p><p>As before, repeat your practice upon the hour. Take it with you. Do not forget.</p><p>像以前一样，每小时重复一次练习。随身带着它。不要忘记。</p><p>Practice 192: Two 30-minute practice periods. Hourly practice.</p><p>练习192：两个 30 分钟的练习时段。每小时练习。</p>]]></content>

      <title>第一百九十一阶：我的内识超越我的人性</title>
      <link href="/2024/10/06/191/"/>
      <url>/2024/10/06/191/</url>
      
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="STEP-191-MY-KNOWLEDGE-IS-GREATER-THAN-MY-HUMANITY"><a href="#STEP-191-MY-KNOWLEDGE-IS-GREATER-THAN-MY-HUMANITY" class="headerlink" title="STEP 191 MY KNOWLEDGE IS GREATER THAN MY HUMANITY."></a>STEP 191 MY KNOWLEDGE IS GREATER THAN MY HUMANITY.</h2><p>Your Knowledge is born of life universal. It eclipses your humanity but gives your humanity true  meaning. Greater Life wishes to express itself in your world, in your era and in the circumstances that actually exist now. Thus, the great expresses itself through the small, and the small experiences itself as the great. This is the way of all life. Your humanity is without meaning unless it serves a greater context and is a part of a Greater Reality. Without this, it is more a form of bondage—a restraint, a confinement and an imposition upon your nature rather than an affirmation of your nature. </p><p>你的内识诞生于宇宙的生命。它超越了你的人性，但又赋予你的人性真实的意义。更伟大的生命希望在你们的世界、你们的时代和现在实际存在的环境中表达自己。因此，伟大通过渺小来表达自己，而渺小通过伟大来体验自己。这是所有生命的法则。你的人性没有意义，除非它服务于一个更大的背景并成为一个更大现实的一部分。没有这一点，它更像是一种束缚——一种限制、一种禁锢和一种强加于你自然的枷锁，而非对你自然的肯定。</p><p>Your Knowledge is greater than your humanity. Thus, your humanity can have meaning, for it has something to serve. Without service, your humanity is merely a restraint, that which confines you and imprisons you. But your humanity is meant to serve a Greater Reality which you carry within you today. This Reality is in you, but you do not own it. You cannot use it for your own personal fulfillment. You can only receive it and allow it to express itself. It will express itself through your humanity, and it will give you a greater experience of yourself.</p><p>你的内识超越你的人性。因此，你的人性才能拥有意义，因为它有服务的对象。如果没有服务，你的人性只是一种束缚，将你限制和囚禁的枷锁。但是，你的人性是为了服务于一个更伟大的现实，而这个现实今天就在你的内心深处。这个现实就在你的内心，但你并不拥有它。你无法使用它来实现你的个人满足。你只能接受它，并允许它表达自己。它将通过你的人性来表达自己，它将给你带来更伟大的自我体验。</p><p>In your longer practice periods today, allow yourself to enter stillness once again, and upon the hour repeat this idea so that you may consider its true meaning. Do not accept mere assumptions or premature conclusions, for today’s idea will require your deep involvement. Life has depth. You must penetrate it. You must enter into it. You must receive it and inquire within it. Then you will become re-engaged in your natural relationship with life.</p><p>在今天较长的练习时间中，让自己再次进入静心状态，每小时重复这个想法，以便你能够思考它的真实意义。不要接受单纯的假设或过早的结论，因为今天的想法将需要你的深度参与。生命有其深度。你必须渗透它。你必须进入它。你必须接纳它，并在其中探寻。然后，你将重新投入与你自然生命关系的互动。</p><p>Practice 191: Two 30-minute practice periods. Hourly practice.</p><p>练习 191 ：两个30分钟的练习时段。每小时练习。</p>]]></content>

It is a turning point where your world gains contact with the worlds in its vicinity. This is the natural evolution of humanity, as it is the natural evolution of all intelligent life in all worlds. Your world is seeking a Greater Community. This will require that your world’s own internal community become unified. This is also a part of the evolution of all intelligent life in all worlds. You have come here to serve this. There are many levels of service and many things that need to be contributed—on a personal, on a community and on a world level. You are part of this great movement of life, for you are not here for your own purposes alone. You are here to serve the world, and thus be served in return.</p><p>你在一个伟大的转折点进入了这个世界，而在你有生之年，你只能看到这转折点的一部分。这是一个转折点，你们的世界开始与邻近的世界接触。这是人类的自然进化，正如所有世界中所有智能生命的自然进化一样。你们的世界正在寻求一个大社区。这要求你们的世界内部的社会必须团结一致。这也是所有智能生命进化的一部分。你来到这里是为了服务这个目标。在个人、社区和世界的层面上，都有许多不同层级的服务需要贡献。你是这个生命伟大运动的一部分，因为你来到这里并不只是为了你自己。你在这里是为了服务这个世界，从而得到服务的回报。</p><p>Today in your two longer practice periods, investigate the idea for the day. Give it serious thought, observing those ideas that are in harmony with it and those ideas that disagree with it. Examine your feelings both for and against this idea. Examine your preferences, your prejudices, your beliefs, your hopes, your fears and so forth. This constitutes the first half of each practice period. In the second half, enter stillness and silence, using the word RAHN if you find it to be helpful. Remember that both of these mental activities are necessary and complementary, as you shall learn in the future. Upon the hour repeat the idea for today. Allow it to provide that which you need to see the world in a new way.</p><p>今天，在两个较长的练习时间里，研究一下今天的想法。认真思考，观察与之相一致的想法和不一致的想法。审视你对这个想法的支持和反对的感觉。审视自己的偏好、偏见、信仰、希望和恐惧等等。这就是每次练习的前半部分。后半部分，进入静止和沉默状态，如果你觉得RAHN这个词对你有帮助，就使用它。记住，这两种心理活动都是必要的，也是相辅相成的，这一点你以后会学到。每小时重复一次今天的想法。让它为你提供以新的方式看待世界所需要的技能。</p><p>Practice 190: Two 30-minute practice periods. Hourly practice.</p><p>练习 190 ：两个30分钟的练习时段。每小时练习。</p>]]></content>

      <title>第一百八十九阶：我的精神家庭存在于所有地方</title>
      <link href="/2024/09/29/189/"/>
      <url>/2024/09/29/189/</url>
      
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="STEP-189-MY-SPIRITUAL-FAMILY-EXISTS-IN-ALL-PLACES"><a href="#STEP-189-MY-SPIRITUAL-FAMILY-EXISTS-IN-ALL-PLACES" class="headerlink" title="STEP 189 MY SPIRITUAL FAMILY EXISTS IN ALL PLACES."></a>STEP 189 MY SPIRITUAL FAMILY EXISTS IN ALL PLACES.</h2><p>Your Spiritual Family is greater than you realize. It exists in many worlds. Its influence is everywhere.  That is why it is so meaningless to consider yourself to be alone when you are part of something so great that serves the greatest of all purposes. You must relinquish your selfcondemnation and your sense of littleness to know this, for you have identified with your behavior in the world, which is little. You have identified with your personal mind and your physical body, which are little. Yet now you are beginning to realize your relationship with life itself through Knowledge, which is great. This is done without punishing the personal mind or the physical body, for they become useful and enjoyable as they learn to serve a greater purpose. Then the body has health and the personal mind is utilized, rendering them meaning which they now lack.</p><p>你的精神家庭比你想象的更为广阔。它存在于许多世界，它的影响力无处不在。正因如此，当你属于一个如此伟大的整体并为最伟大的目的服务时，认为自己是孤立的显得毫无意义。要想知道这一点，你必须放弃对自己的谴责和自卑感，因为你已经与自己在世界中的行为相认同，而这些行为是渺小的。你也与个人的心灵和物质身体相认同，而它们也是渺小的。然而，现在你开始通过内识意识到自己与生命本身的关系，这种关系是伟大的。这并不是要惩罚个人的心灵或物质身体，因为它们在学会服务于更伟大的目的时会变得有用且令人愉悦。届时，身体会保持健康，个人的心灵会被善用，从而赋予它们现在所缺乏的意义。</p><p>Your physical need is for health, but your health is to serve a greater purpose. You need right utilization for your personal mind, which will give it meaning and value, for it only seeks to be included in that which is meaningful. What enables your personal mind and your physical body to find their rightful place in your life is Knowledge, which provides purpose, meaning and direction for you. </p><p>你在身体上的需求是健康，但你的健康是为了服务一个更伟大的目的。你需要正确地善用你的个人心灵，这将赋予它意义和价值，因为它只渴望被包含在有意义的事情中。使你的个人心灵和物质身体在你的生命中找到正确位置的，是内识，它为你提供了目的、意义和方向。</p><p>This is true in all worlds. This is true throughout the physical universe of which you are a citizen. Expand your view of yourself so that you may learn to be objective about your world. Do not merely cast human values, assumptions and goals upon your world, for this blinds you to the world’s purpose and evolution and makes it far more difficult for you to appreciate that you are a citizen of a greater life. </p><p>在所有的世界中都是如此。在你作为其公民的物质宇宙中也是如此。扩展你对自己的看法，这样你才能客观地看待你的世界。不要仅仅将人类的价值观、假设和目标投射到你的世界上，因为这会使你对世界的目的和进化视而不见，并使你更难体会到你是一个更伟大生命的公民。</p><p>Today, in your two longer practices, engage your mind in active investigation of this idea. Spend the first fifteen minutes engaged in this investigation in both of your two longer practice periods. Try to seriously investigate the meaning of today’s idea. Then when your investigation is complete, allow your mind to re-enter stillness. Realize the contrast between active mental engagement and mental stillness. Understand that both are important and complement one another. Upon the hour repeat the idea and consider it as you view the world around you.</p><p>今天，在你两次较长时间的练习中，让你的心灵积极地探索这个想法。在两次较长的练习期间的前十五分钟，专注于这一探索。认真地探讨今天这个想法的意义。然后，当你的探索完成时，让你的心灵再次进入静止状态。意识到积极的心理参与和心灵静心之间的对比。理解两者都很重要，并且相辅相成。每小时重复一次今天的想法，并在你观察周围世界时思考它。</p><p>Practice 189: Two 30-minute practice periods. Hourly practice.</p><p>练习 189 ：两个30分钟的练习时段。每小时练习。</p>]]></content>

No, it is not. Does this idea betray your need for humility? No, it does not. You are here for a greater purpose than you have imagined, for your imagination does not contain the meaning of your purpose in life. In life there is only purpose and all the things that are substitutes for this purpose, which are born of fearful imagination. You are here to live a greater life than you have yet realized, and this greatness is what you carry within you. It may be expressed in the simplest of lifestyles and in the simplest of activities. Activities are great because of the essence that they convey, not because of the stimulation that they may arouse in other people.</p><p>这是否是一种夸大的想法？不，它不是。这个想法是否暴露了你需要谦逊？不，它没有。你来到这里的目的比你想象的更伟大，因为你的想象未能涵盖你生命目的的真正意义。在生命中，只有目的，以及那些替代目的的事物，而这些事物是出于恐惧的想象。你来到这里是为了过一种比你目前意识到的更伟大的生命，而这种伟大存在于你的内心深处。它可能在最简单的生活方式和最简单的活动中表达出来。活动之所以伟大，是因为它们所传达的实质，而不是因为它们可能在其他人中引发的刺激。</p><p>Understand this distinction very carefully, and you will begin to learn to discern greatness from smallness and to learn how smallness can serve greatness. This will integrate every aspect of yourself, for part of you is great and part of you is small. Your personal mind and your physical body are small and are meant to serve the greatness of Knowledge. This integrates you. This is what integrates life as well. There is no inequality here, for everything is working together to serve a greater purpose, which you have come to serve.</p><p>要非常仔细地理解这个区分，你将开始学会分辨伟大与渺小，并学会如何让渺小为伟大服务。这将整合你自己的一切，因为你的一部分是伟大的，而另一部分是渺小的。你的个人心灵和身体是渺小的，它们是为了服务于内识的伟大而存在的。这使你得以整合。这也是整合生命的方式。这里没有不平等，因为一切都在共同服务于一个更伟大的目的，而你来到这里正是为了服务这个目的。</p><p>In your longer practice periods today, engage your mind actively in attempting to understand these things. Your understanding will be born of your investigation, not merely of ideas that you find self-comforting or personally agreeable. Use your mind to investigate. With eyes closed, think on these things. Concentrate very carefully, and when your concentration comes to an end, release all ideas and enter into stillness and silence. Thus, the mind is purposefully engaged, and then it is brought into stillness. These are the two functions of the mind, which you will be practicing today. </p><p>今天在你较长的练习时间里，积极运用你的心灵，尝试去理解这些事情。你的理解将来源于你的探索，而不仅仅是你找到的那些让你感到安慰或个人认同的想法。运用你的心灵进行探索。闭上眼睛，思考这些问题。非常仔细地集中注意力，当你的专注结束时，放下所有的想法，进入静止与沉默。因此，心灵被有目的地投入使用，然后进入静心。这是心灵的两种功能，你今天将会练习这两种功能。</p><p>Remind yourself of your practice upon the hour and utilize this day for your development, which is your gift to the world.</p><p>每小时提醒自己的练习，并利用这一天来发展你自己，而这正是你对世界的馈赠。</p><p>Practice 188: Two 30-minute practice periods. Hourly practice.</p><p>练习 188 ：两个 30 分钟的练习时段。每小时练习。</p>]]></content>

You are a citizen of the Greater Community  of worlds. This is the physical universe that you recognize through your senses. It is far greater than you can now comprehend. The extent of its relationships are far greater than you can even imagine, for reality is always greater than imagination. </p><p>你不仅仅是这个世界上的一个人类。你是世界大社区的公民。这是你通过感官所识别的物质宇宙。它远比你现在所能理解的要广阔得多。它关系的深度超出了你所能想象的范围，因为现实总是超越想象。</p><p>You are a citizen of a greater physical universe. This acknowledges not only your Lineage and your Heritage but also your purpose in life at this time, for the world of humanity is growing into the life of the Greater Community of worlds. This is known to you, though your beliefs may not yet account for it.</p><p>你是一个更大物质宇宙的公民。这不仅承认了你的世系和传承，也承认了你此时在生命中的目的，因为人类世界正在融入世界大社区的生命之中。虽然你们的信仰可能还无法解释这一点，但你是知道的。</p><p>Today, upon the hour, affirm your citizenship in the Greater Community of worlds, for this affirms a greater life that you are now beginning to discover. In your two meditation practices, once again enter stillness and quietude. This growing experience of stillness will enable you to understand all things, for your mind was created to assimilate Knowledge, and this is how understanding comes about. The accumulation of ideas and the accumulation of theories do not constitute either Knowledge or understanding, for understanding is born of true affinity and experience. In this, it has no parallel in the world and can thus serve the world that you perceive.</p><p>今天，在每个小时，确认你是世界大社区的公民，因为这肯定了你现在开始发现的更大生命。在你的两次冥想练习中，再次进入静止与安静。这种日益增长的静心体验将使你能够理解一切，因为你的心灵是为了吸收内识而创造的，而理解就是通过这种方式产生的。想法的积累和理论的积累并不构成内识或理解，因为理解源于真实的亲和力和体验。在这一点上，它在世界上没有任何平行之物，因此能够服务于你所感知的世界。</p><p>Practice 187: Two 30-minute practice periods.

This will arise in your mind naturally, though it is beyond  words and beyond description. In essence, it is a pure experience of life and inclusion. What is remembered in this experience are those relationships that you have cultivated thus far in your evolution up until this time. Only the reclamation of relationships can be carried forward beyond your life in this world. The individuals that you have reclaimed unto yourself as your Spiritual Family now exist as your Spiritual Family. They form the growing body of Knowledge and inclusion in life which you are now capable of experiencing.</p><p>你诞生于古老的传承。这将在你的心灵中自然升起，尽管它超越话语和描述。从本质上讲，这是一种对生命和包容的纯粹体验。在这种体验中，所记住的是你在进化过程中迄今为止所培养的那些关系。只有关系的恢复可以超越你在这个世界的生命，并将这个生命带入未来。那些被你视为精神家园的个体，现在正作为你的精神家园而存在。他们构成了你现在能够体验的内识和生命包容的不断增长的主体。</p><p>You are here to serve your Spiritual Family, your small learning group that have been working together through many ages and circumstances in order to cultivate and advance their members so that your group may join with other groups, and so forth. Like streams joining together into greater and greater bodies of moving water, you follow your inevitable course to the source of your life. This is the natural way, the genuine way, the way that exists beyond all speculation and philosophy, beyond all the fears and ambitions of humanity. This is the way of things—forever mysterious, beyond your comprehension and yet fully available to serve you in the immediate circumstances of your life. Such is the greatness of the mystery of your life, and such is its application in even the smallest detail of your life. Thus, your life here is complete. </p><p>你在此服务于你的精神家庭，你的小型学习小组，这些小组经过多个时代和不同的境遇共同努力，培养和提升他们的成员，以便你们的小组能够与其他小组联合，就像溪流汇聚成越来越大的流动水体，顺应生命的源头而流动。这是自然的道路，真正的道路，超越所有猜测和哲学，超越人类所有的恐惧和野心的道路。这是事物的方式——永远神秘，超越你的理解，但在你生命的每一个细节中都完全可以为你服务。这就是你生命的伟大神秘，也是它在你生命中每一个最小细节中的应用。因此，你的生命在这里是完整的。</p><p>You are born of a great Heritage. Thus, greatness is with you because of your relationships. Receive this Heritage in stillness in your two deep meditation practices today and acknowledge it upon the hour. Allow this day to demonstrate both the reality and the denial of this great truth, for as you see the world in its denial attempting to act out the substitutes for Knowledge, you will learn to value Knowledge and to realize that Knowledge is here already.</p><p>你诞生于伟大的传承。因此，伟大与你同在，因为你的关系。今天，在你两次深度冥想的静心中接纳这份传承，并在每个整点时刻确认它。让今天展示这个伟大真理的现实和否认，当你看到世界在否认内识的过程中试图表现出替代品时，你将学会珍视内识，并意识到内识已经在这里准备就绪。</p><p>Practice 186: Two 30-minute practice periods.

Regardless of your current stage of personal development, the reality of your purpose in life remains true. Therefore, from time to time We repeat certain lessons that are essential for your well-being and development. We give them different wording from time to time so that you may have a greater and greater experience of them. In this way, they may find their way into your heart so that your heart may find its way into your consciousness.</p><p>我们再次确认这个伟大的真理，当你拥有内识时，你会知道它是真实的。无论你个人发展的阶段如何，你生命中的目的始终存在。因此，我们会不时重复某些对你的福祉和发展至关重要的课程。我们会以不同的措辞表达它们，这样你就可以越来越深刻地体验到它们。这样，它们可以找到通往你内心的道路，从而你的内心可以进入你的意识。</p><p>You are here to serve. You are here to give. You are here because you are rich with Knowledge. Regardless of your circumstance in life, your own sense of poverty will be banished forever as Knowledge arises within you, for there can be no sense of deprivation when Knowledge is being experienced and expressed. This is the promise of this program of preparation. This is the promise of your life. This is your destiny and your mission here. From this, your specific calling in the world will be given to you. It will be quite specific to your activities and behavior. Before this can happen, your mind must be cultivated, and your life must be rearranged and brought into genuine balance so that it may reflect your Knowledge and not your fears and wishes only. A greater life must come from a Greater Source within you. A greater life is made possible for you now.</p><p>你来到这里是为了服务。你在这里是为了给予。你在这里是因为你拥有内识的财富。不管你现在的生命状况如何，当内心深处的内识在你内心升起时，你对贫乏的感受将永远消失，因为在体验和表达内识时，不会有任何匮乏感。这就是这项准备计划的承诺，也是你生命的承诺。这是你的天命和你在这里的使命。从这一点出发，你在世界上的具体召唤将会向你展现。它将具体体现在你的行为和活动中。但在这发生之前，你的心灵必须得到培养，你的生命必须重新调整并达到真正的平衡，使其反映你的内识，而不仅仅是你的恐惧和愿望。一个更伟大的生命必须来自你内心深处更伟大的本源。现在，一个更伟大的生命对你而言是可能的。</p><p>You are here to serve, but to serve you must receive. In your longer practice periods today, practice receptivity. Go deeper in your practice of stillness. Cultivate this practice. You are now learning the specific skills that will help you to do this. When your will is being experienced, the methods will follow naturally. We give only so much methodology as is necessary to aim your mind in the proper direction. From here you can refine your practice to meet your needs without betraying the instructions that are given in this course. </p><p>你来到这里是为了服务，但要服务，你必须先收到。在今天的较长练习时间里，练习接收能力。加深你在静心中的练习。培养这种练习。你现在正在学习帮助你做到这一点的具体技能。当你的意志得到体验时，方法会自然地随之而来。我们只提供足够的技巧来引导你的心灵朝向正确的方向。从这里开始，你可以根据自己的需求精细化练习，而不背离本课程中给予的指导。</p><p>Therefore, follow the directions that are given and make minor adjustments as necessary. When you learn to work with your nature, you will learn to utilize it on your own behalf. Practice upon the hour so that your practice may go with you everywhere and so that everything that happens to you today may be a part of your practice.</p><p>因此，遵循所给予的指示，并根据需要进行小的调整。当你学会与自己的自然合作时，你将学会使用它为你自己服务。每小时进行练习，这样你的练习可以伴随你走到任何地方，并且今天发生的每一件事都可以成为你练习的一部分。</p><p>Practice 185: Two 30-minute practice periods.

Though your questions may have arisen out of immediate circumstances, you are asking for far more than immediate resolution to immediate things. Immediate resolution will be given, but from a Greater Source. It is this Greater Source that you are seeking, for you are seeking to realize your nature here, and you are seeking to find the preparation that will enable you to contribute your gifts so that your work in the world may be complete. Therefore, understand that you are here to serve. You are here to give. And in so doing, you will find your fulfillment. This will produce happiness for you.</p><p>你真正寻求的远远超过了你以前所想象的。虽然你的问题可能源于眼前的境况，但你所要求的远不止是对当下问题的解决。眼前的问题会得到解决，但解决将来自一个更伟大的源头。而你正在寻找的，正是这个更伟大的源头，因为你正在寻求认识你在此的自然，你正在寻找能够帮助你贡献自己的礼物的准备，这样你的世间工作才能圆满完成。因此，要理解你在这里是为了服务。你在这里是为了给予。而在这么做的过程中，你将找到自己的满足。这将为你带来幸福。</p><p>In your two longer practice periods today, once again enter into stillness and silence, keeping in mind that stillness cultivates the mind to receive. In stillness you find that things are known already that you have neglected thus far. From these practice periods your mind will become more refined and have greater depth, greater concentration and a greater focus in all aspects of your life. </p><p>在今天的两次较长的练习时间中，再次进入静心与沉默，记住静心培养心灵去接收。在静心中，你会发现一些你早已知道却至今忽视的关系。通过这些练习，你的心灵将变得更加精炼，并在生命的各个方面拥有更大的深度、更强的专注力和更集中的焦点。</p><p>What you are seeking today is something greater than you have considered before.

Seek experience today so that it may lead you to greater and greater experience. It is better for you to ask questions of Knowledge and then receive the experience that Knowledge can give you. You are accustomed to receiving so little in response to your inquiries. An answer is so very little. A true answer must be an invitation to participate in a greater preparation, in a preparation you have not prepared for yourself but which has been prepared for you. Therefore, seek not for little things that give you momentary relief or comfort. Seek for that which is the foundation of your life, which can provide life to you as never before.</p><p>今天去寻求体验，因为体验会回答所有问题，并使提问变得不再必要。今天去寻求体验，因为它会引领你走向越来越多的体验。最好是向内识提问，然后接受内识可以带给你的体验。你习惯于从询问中得到很少的回应。一个答案是如此微不足道。一个真实的答案必须是一种邀请，邀请你参与到一个更大的准备之中，一种你尚未为自己做好的准备，但内识已经为你做好准备。因此，不要只寻求那些能给你短暂解脱或安慰的小事。要寻求的是你生命的根基，它可以以一种前所未有的方式给予你生命。</p><p>Today, in your two deeper practices, become receptive to this experience. You may use the word RAHN if you find it helpful, but enter deeply into the experience of Knowledge. Do not seek for answers. Ideas will come to you in their own time and in their own way. You can be assured of that. As your mind is prepared, it will become truly receptive and truly capable of carrying out what it receives. This is the acknowledgment that you need. It must be born of great experience.</p><p>今天，在你两次深入的练习中，要对这种体验保持接纳的态度。如果你觉得有帮助，可以使用RAHN这个词，但要深深进入内识的体验。不要去寻求答案。想法会在自己的时间、以自己的方式出现在你面前。这一点你可以放心。当你的心灵做好准备，它将真正具备接受和执行它所接收内识的能力。这就是你需要的确认，它必须源于伟大的体验。</p><p>Upon the hour remind yourself of your practice, and realize it is genuine experience that you are seeking and not answers alone. Your mind is full of answers, and they have not answered your questioning thus far.</p><p>每小时提醒自己进行练习，并意识到你真正寻求的是体验，而不仅仅是答案。你的心灵中充满了答案，但它们至今没有解答你的疑问。</p><p>Practice 183: Two 30-minute practice periods.

Today marks the completion of the first stage of your preparation and the beginning of a new stage. Review the past week in one long practice period and then take time to think how far you have come and how far you need to go. Recognize your growing power and strength. Think of your outer life and recognize how much needs to be accomplished there, both on your own behalf and for the well-being of others. Recognize how little you know and how much is available to you. Do not let any self-doubt dissuade you in your undertaking, for you need only participate to receive the greatest gift that life can give.</p><p>今天标志着你准备过程中的一个重要转折点。今天标志着你准备的第一阶段的完成，以及一个新阶段的开始。在一个长时间的练习中回顾过去的一周，然后花时间思考你已经走了多远，以及你还需要走多远。认识到你日益增长的力量和能力。想一想你的外在生活，认识到在你自己以及他人的福祉方面，还有许多需要完成的事情。认识到你所知道的很少，但你可以获得的却很多。不要让任何自我怀疑阻碍你，因为你只需参与其中，即可获得生命能给予的最伟大的礼物。</p><p>Review the past week and think now of what has transpired in your preparation thus far. Observe the development that has occurred within you these past few months—the growing sense of presence, the growing sense of inner certainty, the growing sense of inner power. Allow for the fact that your outer life has begun to open. Certain things that were fixed before have now been loosened so that they may be rearranged on your behalf. Allow your outer life to be rearranged, now that you are not seeking to dominate it for your personal protection. As a greater certainty arises within you, outer circumstances must be rearranged on your own behalf. Thus, you become a source of change and not the recipient of it only. </p><p>回顾过去的一周，思考你到目前为止的准备过程。观察过去几个月内你自身的发展——日益增强的存在感、日益增强的内在确定性、日益增强的内在力量。承认你的外在生活已经开始打开。一些之前固定的事物现在已经松动，以便为你重新安排。现在，你不再为了个人的安全而试图掌控它时，允许你的外在生活被重新安排。随着你内在的确定性增强，外部环境也必须为你重新调整。因此，你成为了改变的源头，而不仅仅是被动接受改变的人。</p><p>Recognize how far you have come, but keep in mind that you are a beginning student of Knowledge. Allow this to be your starting point so that you may assume little and receive a great deal. From this great point of reference, you will be able to see beyond the prejudice and the condemnation of humanity. You will be able to see beyond a personal viewpoint and have a vision of the world that the world is desperate to receive.</p><p>认识到你已经走了多远，但请记住，你是内识的初学者。让这一点成为你的起点，以便你假设的很少，获得的却很多。从这个伟大的参照点出发，你将能够超越人类的偏见和谴责。你将能够超越个人视角，拥有世界迫切需要的视野。</p><p>Practice 182: One long practice period.</p><p>练习 182 ：一段漫长的练习期</p>]]></content>

Knowledge is the seed of true love, not the love that seeks to conquer, to possess and to dominate, but the love that seeks to serve, to empower and to free another. Become the recipient of this love today so that it may flow through you to the world, for without your denial it will most surely do this. </p><p>内识拥有真实之爱的种子，不是那种仅仅是情感的爱，也不是那种源于恐惧的急切欲望所带来的迷醉之爱。内识是孕育真实之爱的种子，这不是那种试图征服、占有和控制的爱，而是寻求服务、赋权以及解放他人的爱。今天成为这份爱的接受者，让它通过你流向世界，因为如果你不拒绝它，它必然会这样做。</p><p>Upon the hour, repeat this statement and feel its full impact, regardless of the circumstance that you find yourself in. Allow each circumstance to support your practice, and you will find that your practice will have an increasingly potent effect on your external life. In your two deeper practices today, enter into the presence of Knowledge and receive its love. Affirm your worthiness and your receptivity. Relinquish your presumptions about yourself and the world, and allow yourself to have an experience that will demonstrate the truth beyond any assumption. This is your practice today. This is your gift to yourself, to your world and to your Creator so that you may receive the gift of love.</p><p>每小时重复这个声明，感受它的全部影响，无论你处于何种情境中。让每个情境都支持你的练习，你会发现你的练习会对你的外在生活产生越来越强的影响。在今天两次深入的练习中，进入内识的存在，接纳它的爱。确认你值得并能够接受。放下你对自己和世界的假设，允许自己体验一种超越任何假设的真理。这就是你今天的练习。这是你给予自己、给予你的世界以及给予造物主的礼物，这样你就能收到这份爱的礼物。</p><p>Practice 181: Two 30-minute practice periods.

Knowledge has its own statement about life, but it is very different from the lament which you hear within yourself and around you. Therefore, as you approach Knowledge today, recognize the nature of complaint—how it emphasizes your weakness and the world’s domination over you and how much it is in contrast to what you are learning now. You are learning now to discover your greatness and your domination over the world. You are in relationship with the world. Let this relationship become healthy and meaningful. Let the world’s contribution be given to you. Let your contribution be given to the world. </p><p>当你抱怨生命时，你其实是在向内识寻求帮助。内识对生命有其独特的见解，但它与你内心和周围听到的哀叹截然不同。因此，当你今天走向内识时，要认识到抱怨的本质——它如何强调你的弱点以及世界对你的控制，而这与现在你所学习的内容有多么大的对比。你正在学习如何发现自己的伟大和对世界的掌控。你与世界有着关系，让这种关系变得健康且有意义。让世界的馈赠传递给你，也让你的馈赠回馈给世界。</p><p>Therefore, thank the world once again today for what it has given to you. In your deeper meditation practices today, enter stillness and silence. Use the word RAHN to help you enter this deeply. Use the word RAHN to orient your mind and thinking so that your mind may become unified with the sound of this one ancient word. </p><p>因此，今天再次感谢世界给予你的所有。在今天更深的冥想练习中，进入静心与沉默。使用RAHN这个词帮助你深深地进入这种状态。使用RAHN来引导你的心灵和思维，使你的心灵与这个古老词汇的声音融为一体。</p><p>This is a day of important contribution. Do not complain about this day. Recognize that everything that happens is an opportunity for you to apply your practice and to develop the true faculties of your mind. Your complaint would only be a denial of the world’s contribution to you. Therefore, do not deny this. Do not complain about the world today so that you may receive its gifts.</p><p>今天是一个具有重要贡献的一天。不要对这一天抱怨。要认识到，所发生的一切都为你提供了运用你的实践和发展你心灵真实能力的机会。你的抱怨只会否定世界对你的贡献。因此，不要否认这一点。不要抱怨今天的世界，这样你才能收到它的礼物。</p><p>Practice 180: Two 30-minute practice periods.</p><p>练习 180 ：两个 30 分钟的练习时段</p>]]></content>

Contrast must be evident in learning for you to make these distinctions. To distinguish what is true from what is false and what is meaningful from what is meaningless, you must have contrast in learning. You must taste the meaningless to find out its true nature and content, and you must taste the meaningful to find out its true nature and content. The world continuously provides you the opportunity to do both. </p><p>世界在其宏伟和愚昧中教会你什么值得珍视，并让你认识到什么是真实的。学习中必须显现对比，这样你才能做出这些区分。要分辨真实与虚假、意义与无意义，你必须在学习中体验对比。你必须品尝无意义的关系，以发现它的本质和内容；你也必须品尝有意义的关系，以发现它的本质和内容。世界不断为你提供这两种体验的机会。</p><p>At this time your need is to taste the true, increasingly, and that is why We emphasize this in your daily practice now. You have already indulged yourself in the false so sufficiently that it has dominated your mind and attention. Now We feed you the true, but you must also learn to benefit from what the false has given you. Then you will need to investigate the false no more. The false has already presented itself to you. Now you are learning to recognize its presentation and to utilize what benefit it can offer you. The only benefit the false can offer you is to learn to recognize its lack of substance so that you may desire to know what is true and have greater capacity to receive it. </p><p>此刻，你需要越来越多地品尝真实，这就是为什么我们现在在你的日常练习中强调这一点。你已经充分沉迷于虚假，以至于它主宰了你的心灵和注意力。现在，我们给予你真实的体验，但你也必须学会从虚假中受益。这样，你就不再需要探究虚假。虚假已经向你展示了自己。现在你正在学习识别它的表现，并使用它能给你带来的任何益处。虚假能给你的唯一益处就是让你认识到它缺乏实质，从而使你渴望知道真实，并具有更大的能力去接纳真实。</p><p>Thus, thank the world today for supporting you, for its grandeur and for its folly, for its moments of inspiration and for its great display of illusion. The world you see so far is largely comprised of the fantasy of individuals, but there is a greater world for you to see, a world that is actually there, a world that will arouse in you Knowledge, appreciation and true self-application as well. For it is your purpose to serve the evolution of this world, as it is the world’s purpose to serve your evolution.</p><p>因此，今天感谢世界对你的支持，感谢它的宏伟和愚昧，感谢它激发灵感的时刻以及它所呈现的巨大幻象。你目前所看到的世界在很大程度上是个人幻想的集合，但还有一个更大的世界等着你去看，一个真实存在的世界，一个能唤起你内识的世界、欣赏和真实自我应用的世界。因为你的目的在于服务这个世界的进化，就如同这个世界的目的在于服务你的进化。</p><p>In your two longer practice periods today, investigate this idea actively with your mind. Apply your mind to understanding how the world has supported you. Think very carefully about this. This is not a superficial investigation. It is an investigation that you must conduct with necessity and with seriousness, for it will determine your experience in life, both in the present and in the future.</p><p>今天，在你两个较长的练习时间里，运用你的心灵积极探究这个理念。运用你的心灵去理解世界是如何支持你的。认真思考这个问题。这不是一个表面的探究。这是一个你必须带着必要性和严肃性进行的探究，因为它将决定你在生命中的经验，无论是现在还是未来。</p><p>Upon the hour, remember Our statement for today and keep it in mind when you view the world. Do not let this day be wasted upon you. This day is a day of recognition, a day of gratitude and a day of wisdom.</p><p>每小时提醒自己今天的陈述，并在观察世界时牢记在心。不要让这一天在你身上白费。这一天是一个认知的日子，一个感恩的日子，一个智慧的日子。</p><p>Practice 179: Two 30-minute practice periods.

Try to think very carefully of the individuals who have given benefit to you, both by demonstrating their wisdom and their error. Think of those who have illustrated the way to go and the way not to go. As you inquire further into this in your two longer practice periods today, try to think more carefully and allow any individual who comes to mind to be the subject of your investigation.

Learn to recognize their contribution to the reclamation of Knowledge. Learn to recognize their contribution to your physical and emotional well-being. Learn to recognize how they have served you. In this way, your entire concept of giving and receiving and of service in the world may be expanded and developed. This will give you a true vision of the world so that you may learn to be compassionate with yourself and with others. </p><p>在较长的练习时间中，在练习开始时重复这一句话，让人们浮现在你的心灵中。学会认识他们对内识回归的贡献。学会认识他们对你身心健康的贡献。学会认识他们如何服务于你。通过这种方式，你关于给予和接收以及在世界中服务的整个概念都可以被扩展和发展。这将给予你对世界的真实愿景，使你学会对自己和他人富有同情心。</p><p>This, then, is a day of affirmation and a day of gratitude.

There is a greater honesty that you must utilize on your own behalf. It is not enough merely to know how you feel. It is a greater requirement to feel what you know. This is a greater honesty and an honesty that is in harmony with life itself, an honesty that reflects the true advancement of all beings in the world. This is not merely expressing and demanding that your personal intent be carried out. It is demanding instead that the necessity of life within you may express itself in a way that is genuine to life itself. The form and the manner of this expression will be contained in the messages that you will need to deliver to others when the time comes for that to happen.</p><p>有一种更大的诚实等待你去发现。你必须运用这种更大的诚实来支持自己。仅仅知道自己的感受是不够的，更大的要求是感受你所知道的。这是一种更大的诚实，一种与生命本身和谐的诚实，一种反映世界上所有生命真实进步的诚实。这不仅仅是表达和要求你个人的意图被执行，而是要求你内心深处生命的必要性以一种真正符合生命本身的方式来表达。当时机成熟时，这种表达的形式和方式将包含在你需要传递给他人的讯息中。</p><p>Learn, then, to feel what you know.

In the longer practices today, again enter stillness and engage your mind in this meaningful activity. The mind must be brought into the proximity of its Ancient Home for it to find comfort and peace. This requires self-discipline at the outset, but once the engagement is made, the process happens in and of itself naturally.</p><p>提醒自己每小时进行一次今天的练习，并在当下认真思考。在今天更长的练习中，再次进入宁静，并让你的心灵参与到这个有意义的活动中。为了找到安慰与和平，心灵必须被带入其古老家园的邻近之地。这在一开始需要自律，但一旦投入其中，这个过程就会自然而然地发生。</p><p>Learn to become more honest today. Learn to discern a greater level of honesty, a genuine level of honesty that affirms your very nature and does not betray your highest purpose.</p><p>今天学会变得更加诚实。学会辨别更高水平的诚实，这种真正的诚实肯定了你的自然，并且不会背叛你的最高宗旨。</p><p>Practice 177: Two 30-minute practice periods.

But greater decisions should be made with Knowledge. </p><p>在今天的每一个小时里，体验自己追随内识。在必要时对小事做出小决定，但在没有内识的情况下不做大决定。你有个人的心智，可以做出微不足道的小决定。但更大的决定应由内识做出。</p><p>Follow Knowledge today upon the hour. Allow its peace and its certainty to abide with you. Allow its overall direction to be discerned by you. Allow its potency to affect you. Allow it to give itself to you as you are now learning to give yourself to it.</p><p>在今天的时刻，跟随内识。让它的平静和确定与你同在。让它的整体方向为你所辨识。让它的力量影响你。让它把自己交给你，就像你现在学习把自己交给它一样。</p><p>In your two longer meditation practices today, using the word RAHN, enter deeply into Knowledge. Enter deeply into the presence of life. Enter deeply into this experience. Continue to direct your mind towards this accomplishment. Continue to set aside anything that affects you or holds you back. In this way, you train the mind and prepare it as well for that which is most natural to it to occur.</p><p>在今天两次较长时间的冥想练习中，使用RAHN这个词，深深地进入内识。深入生命的存在。深深进入这种体验。继续将你的心灵引向这个成就。继续抛开任何影响你或阻碍你的想法。这样，你就能训练自己的心灵，并为最自然的事情发生做好准备。</p><p>Follow Knowledge this day. If Knowledge indicates something and you are very certain about this, follow it and be observant. See what happens and try to learn to distinguish Knowledge from your impulses, your wishes, your fears and your avoidances. This must be learned through experience. In this way, Knowledge and everything that pretends to be Knowledge are drawn apart in contrast. This will provide for you greater certainty and greater self-confidence, which you will need in the times to come.</p><p>这一天，跟随内识。如果内识指出了什么，而你又非常确定，那就跟随它，并多加观察。看看会发生什么，试着学会将内识与你的冲动、愿望、恐惧和逃避区分开来。这必须通过经验来学习。这样，内识和一切假装是内识的东西就会在对比中被区分开来。这将为你提供更大的确定性和更强的自信心，而这正是你未来所需要的。</p><p>Practice 176: Two 30-minute practice periods. Hourly practice.</p><p>练习 176：两个 30 分钟的练习时段。每小时练习。</p>]]></content>

      <title>第一百七十四阶：我的生命是必要的</title>
      <link href="/2024/09/15/174/"/>
      <url>/2024/09/15/174/</url>
      
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Step-174-My-life-is-necessary"><a href="#Step-174-My-life-is-necessary" class="headerlink" title="Step 174 My life is necessary."></a>Step 174 My life is necessary.</h2><p>Your life is necessary. It is not a biological accident. It is not a mere chance circumstance that you arrived  in this world. Your life is necessary. If you could but recall what you went through to come into this world and the preparation that was required—both within this world and beyond—for you to emerge here, then you would realize the importance of your being here and the importance of the Knowledge that you carry within you. Your life is necessary. There is no form of conceit here. It is simply a recognition of truth. In your evaluation of yourself, your life is either pathetic or grandiose. Yet the necessity of your life has nothing to do with your evaluations, though your evaluations can bring you closer to or take you farther from this one true recognition.</p><p>你的生命是必要的。这不是生理上的意外。你来到这个世界并非偶然。你的生命是必要的。如果你能回想一下你来到这个世界所经历的一切，回想一下你在这个世界内外为来到这里所做的准备，你就会意识到你来到这里的重要性，以及你所携带的内识的重要性。你的生命是必要的。这里没有任何形式的自负。这只是对真理的认识。在你对自己的评价中，你的生命要么可悲，要么伟大。然而，你生命的必要性与你的评价无关，尽管你的评价会让你更接近或远离这唯一真实的认知。</p><p>Your life is necessary. Understand this and it will banish your sense of self-judgment and condemnation. Understand this and it will bring humility into your self-grandiose ideas. Understand this and your plans may then in time be adjusted to Knowledge itself, for your life is necessary.</p><p>你的生命是必要的。理解了这一点，你就会摆脱自我评判和谴责。理解了这一点，你自我陶醉的想法就会变得谦逊。理解了这一点，你的计划就可能及时调整为内识本身，因为你的生命是必要的。</p><p>Repeat this statement upon the hour and consider it regardless of your emotions, your circumstances and whatever thoughts are prevailing in your mind, for Knowledge is greater than thoughts and is meant to govern thoughts. In your two meditation practices, allow the word RAHN to take you deep into practice. Feel the necessity of your own life—its value and its importance. This is something that you can experience directly. It does not require your evaluation. It does not require that you consider yourself to be greater than others. It is merely a profound experience of reality, for your life is necessary. It is necessary for you. It is necessary for your world. It is necessary for life itself.</p><p>每隔一小时就重复这句话，无论你的情绪、你的环境和你心中的任何想法如何，都要考虑它，因为内识大于感想，是用来主导感想的。在你的两次冥想练习中，让RAHN这个词带你深入实践。感受自己生命的必要性——它的价值和重要性。这是你可以直接体验到的。它不需要你的评价。它不需要你认为自己比别人伟大。这只是对现实的深刻体验，因为你的生命是必要的。它对你是必要的。它对你的世界是必要的。它对生命本身是必要的。</p><p>Practice 174: Two 30-minute practice periods. Hourly practice.</p><p>练习 174： 两个 30 分钟的练习时段。每小时练习。</p>]]></content>

      <title>第一百七十三阶：今天，我要做必要的事</title>
      <link href="/2024/09/15/173/"/>

This at first seems oppressive to human beings, for they are accustomed to living in fantasy, where everything is preferential and nothing is really necessary.</p><p>做必要的事会让你的生命充满活力，因为世界上各种形式的生命都是在做必要的事。起初，这对人类来说似乎是一种压迫，因为他们习惯于生活在幻想中，在幻想中一切都是优先的，没有什么是真正必要的。</p><p>Yet it is when something is really necessary in life, even if it is a dire circumstance, that people are able to liberate themselves momentarily from their fantasies and feel purpose, meaning and direction. This, then, is a gift to humanity, but people usually give themselves this gift only under dire circumstances.</p><p>然而，正是在生命中某些事情真正变得必要时，哪怕是在危急的情况下，人们才能够暂时从幻想中解放出来，感受到目的、意义和方向。因此，这对人类而言是一份礼物，但人们通常只有在危急的情况下才会给自己这份礼物。</p><p>It is under happier circumstances that you must now learn to receive this and welcome necessity as a saving grace in your life, for you wish to be needed, you wish to be included, you wish to be vital and you wish to be an essential part of community. This is all necessary. It is not merely a preference on your part. It cannot be born of a casual choice but of a deep conviction, for your greater giving must be born of a deep conviction if it is to be great and complete. Otherwise, at the sight of the first adversity or disappointment, you will be cast away and will withdraw back into fantasy and illusion.</p><p>正是在这种更幸福的环境中，你现在必须学会接受这一点，并欢迎将必要性作为你生命中的一种拯救恩典，因为你希望被需要，你希望被包容，你希望有生命力，你希望成为社区的重要组成部分。这一切都是必要的。这不能仅仅是你的喜好。它不能源于随意的选择，而必须源于深刻的信念。因为你更伟大的给予必须源于一种深刻的信念，才能真正伟大而完整。否则，在遇到第一次逆境或失望时，你将会退缩，重新陷入幻想和错觉之中。</p><p>Welcome, then, the necessities of this day. Do small tasks without complaint, for they are small. Follow your procedure today in preparation, for it is necessary and it is great. Do not confuse the great and the small, for the small is only to express the great. Do not try to make the small great or the great small. Understand their true relationship with one another, for within you is both the great and the small. Within you, the great wishes to express itself through the small. </p><p>因此，欢迎今天的必要性。做一些小事，不要抱怨，因为它们很小。按照今天的程序做好准备，因为这是必要的，也是伟大的。不要混淆伟大和渺小，因为渺小只是为了表达伟大。不要试图让渺小变得伟大，也不要试图让伟大变得渺小。理解它们之间的真实关系，因为在你的内心既有伟大，也有渺小。在你的内心，伟大希望通过渺小来表达自己。</p><p>Therefore, carry out your mundane activities today. Do what is necessary today. Remind yourself upon the hour of Our idea for today, and give yourself to your practice so that your day may be a day of giving and receiving. In your deeper meditation practices, enter into stillness using the word RAHN to take you deep into meditation. Do this because it is necessary. Do this with necessity and you will feel the power of your own will.</p><p>因此，今天就开展你的日常活动吧。做今天必须做的事。在我们今天的想法的时刻提醒自己，全身心地投入到实践中去，这样你的一天就会成为给予与收到的一天。在更深的冥想练习中，用RAHN这个词进入静止状态，带你深入冥想。这样做是因为有必要。在必要时这样做，你会感受到自己意志的力量。</p><p>Practice 173: Two 30-minute practice periods. Hourly practice.</p><p>练习 173 ：两个 30 分钟的练习时段。每小时练习。</p>]]></content>

      <title>第一百七十二阶：我必须找回我的内识</title>
      <link href="/2024/09/15/172/"/>
      <url>/2024/09/15/172/</url>
      
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Step-172-I-must-reclaim-my-Knowledge"><a href="#Step-172-I-must-reclaim-my-Knowledge" class="headerlink" title="Step 172 I must reclaim my Knowledge."></a>Step 172 I must reclaim my Knowledge.</h2><p>You must reclaim your Knowledge. It is not merely a preference in competition with other preferences.  The fact that it is a requirement in life gives it the necessity and the importance that it truly deserves. Think not that your freedom is in any way hindered by this necessity, for your freedom is the result of this necessity and will be born of this necessity. Here you enter a world of vital direction rather than casual choices. Here you become seriously engaged in life rather than a removed observer who can only witness your own ideas.</p><p>你必须找回你的内识。它不仅仅是与其他喜好相竞争的喜好。它是生命的必需，这赋予了它真正应有的必要性和重要性。不要认为你的自由会受到这种必要性的任何阻碍，因为你的自由是这种必要性的结果，也将诞生于这种必要性。在这里，你进入的是一个有重要方向的世界，而不是随意选择的世界。在这里，你将认真地参与生命，而不是一个只能见证自己想法的冷眼旁观者。</p><p>The necessity of Knowledge, then, is the importance that it bears for you and for your world. Welcome necessity, then, for it frees you from the aggravation and the disability of ambivalence. It rescues you from meaningless choices and directs you to that which is truly vital for your well-being and for the well-being of the world. Knowledge is a necessity. Your life is a necessity. Its importance is not merely for you alone, but for the world as well.</p><p>因此，内识的必要性就在于它对你和你的世界所具有的重要性。因此，内识的必要性值得欢迎，因为它能让你摆脱矛盾的痛苦和残疾。它把你从无意义的选择中解救出来，引导你去寻找对你和世界的福祉真正重要的工作。内识是必要的。你的生命也是必要的。它的重要性不仅在于你自己，也是为了整个世界。</p><p>If you can comprehend this in truth, this will override any sense of unworthiness or indolence that you may still possess. For if your life is a necessity, then it has purpose, meaning and direction. If your life is a necessity, then all other lives are a necessity as well. In this, you will wish to harm no one but instead will seek to affirm Knowledge in everyone. This necessity, then, bears with it the strength and the direction that you require and provides you with the grace and depth that you must receive for yourself. A necessary life is a meaningful life. Knowledge is a necessity. Give yourself to your necessity, and you will feel that you are a necessity yourself. This will dispel your sense of unworthiness and guilt and bring you back into relationship with life.</p><p>如果你能领会这个真理，这将会超越你可能仍然拥有的任何不值得或懒惰的感觉。因为如果你的生命有了必要性，那么它就有了目的、意义和方向。如果你的生命是必要的，那么其他所有生命也都是必要的。在这一点上，你不希望伤害任何人，反而会努力肯定每个人的内识。因此，这种必要性承载着你所需要的力量和方向，并为你提供了你自己必须接受的恩典和深度。必要的生命才是有意义的生命。内识是一种必需。把自己交给你的必需，你就会觉得自己是必要的。这将消除你的不配感和负罪感，让你重新回到与生命的关系中。</p><p>Practice again upon the hour, and in your two meditation practices allow the word RAHN to take you deeper into the presence of Knowledge itself. The power of this word, a word unknown within your own language, will resonate with your Knowledge and will stimulate it. Thus, the means are mysterious, but the result is concrete.</p><p>每小时再次练习，在你两次的冥想练习中，让词语“RAHN”将你带入内识本身的存在感。这个词语的力量，一个在你语言中未知的词语，将与你的内识产生共鸣并激发它。因此，方法是神秘的，但结果是具体的。</p><p>Practice 172: Two 30-minute practice periods. Hourly practice.</p><p>练习 172 ：两个30分钟的练习时段。每小时练习。</p>]]></content>

It is not  the giving of objects that We speak of here, for you may give away all your possessions and then have none left over. But when you give Knowledge, Knowledge increases. And when you imbue your gift of an object with Knowledge, Knowledge increases. That is why when you receive Knowledge, you will want to give it because this is the natural expression of your own receptivity. </p><p>你的给予是对自己财富的肯定，因为你是在用自己的财富给予的。我们在这里所说的给予并不是物品的给予，因为你可能会给予掉你所有的财产，然后一无所有。但当你给予内识时，内识就会增加。当你在赠送物品时注入内识，内识也会增加。这就是为什么当你接受内识时，你会想要给予它，因为这是你自身接纳能力的自然体现。</p><p>How can you exhaust Knowledge when Knowledge is the Power and the Will of the universe? How small your vehicle, how great the substance that expresses itself through you. How great your relationship with life, and how great, then, are you who are with life. There is no conceit here. There is no self-inflation here, for you realize that you are small and great all at once, and you acknowledge the source of your smallness and the source of your greatness. You acknowledge the value of your smallness and the value of your greatness. You acknowledge all life, then, and nothing is left out of your great evaluation of yourself, which is born of love and true understanding. This, then, is the understanding that you must cultivate over time, realizing again that your efforts to do so are embellished by the efforts of others who are also students of Knowledge in your world. Even students in other worlds embellish your efforts, for in Knowledge there is no time and distance. Thus, you have great support available to you now, and in this you realize your true relationship with life.</p><p>内识是宇宙的力量和意志，你怎能穷尽内识？你的载体何其渺小，但通过你展现的实质却是如此伟大。你与生命的关系是如此伟大，因此，当你与生命同在时，你的伟大也得以体现。这里没有自负。这里没有自我膨胀，因为你意识到自己既渺小又伟大，你承认自己渺小的根源，也承认自己伟大的来源。你承认自己渺小的价值，也承认自己伟大的价值。于是，你承认所有的生命，在对自己进行伟大的评估时，没有任何生命是被遗漏的，这种评价源于爱和真实的理解。因此，这就是你必须长期培养的理解力，你要再次意识到，你的努力会得到你的世界里同样是内识学生的其他人的努力的点缀。即使是其他世界的学生也会点缀你的努力，因为在内识中没有时间和距离。因此，你现在可以得到巨大的支持，并从中认识到自己与生命的真实关系。</p><p>Practice upon the hour and in your deeper meditations, allow the word RAHN to take you into Knowledge. Silently and in stillness, as you sink into the depths of Knowledge, receive the peace and the confirmation that are your birthright.</p><p>在每小时的练习中，在更深层面的冥想中，让RAHN这个词带你进入内识。静静地沉入内识的深处，接受与生俱来的和平与肯定。</p><p>Practice 171: Two 30-minute practice periods.

It has been used for centuries, in this world and in other worlds as well. It is only adapted in its language and in its relevancy to your current time, yet it prepares the mind in the way that minds have always been prepared in The Way of Knowledge, for Knowledge does not change and the preparations only adapt themselves to current events and current understanding so that they may be relevant for the recipients. Yet the true mechanism for preparation is unchanged.</p><p>你所进行的这项准备源自古老的传承。几个世纪以来，它被运用在这个世界和其他世界中。它只是在语言和与当今时局的关联性上做了调整，但它仍然以内识之路的方式来培养心灵，因为内识不会改变，准备工作只是根据当前的事件和当前的理解进行调整，以便与受教育者相关。然而，准备工作的真实机制并没有改变。</p><p>You are undertaking an Ancient Rite in the reclamation of Knowledge. Born of the Great Will of the universe, this preparation has been constructed for the advancement of students of Knowledge. You are working in tandem now with many other individuals, both within this world and within other worlds as well. For Knowledge is being taught in all worlds where intelligent life exists. Thus, your efforts are supported and embellished by the efforts of those who are preparing with you. In this, you represent a community of learners. Think not, then, that your efforts are singular. Think not, then, that you are alone in the world undertaking the reclamation of Knowledge. Think not, then, that you are not part of a community of learners. This will be more evident to you in time as you begin to recognize those who are preparing with you. This will be more evident in time as your experience of the presence of your Teachers deepens. This will be more evident in time as the results of your Knowledge become evident even to you. This will be more evident in time as you consider your life as part of a Greater Community of worlds.</p><p>你正在通过这项古老的仪式进行内识的恢复。这项准备源自宇宙的伟大意志，为了内识的学生们而构建。你现在正与许多其他个体同步工作，不仅在这个世界，还有其他世界也是如此。因为内识在所有有智能生命存在的世界中都被教授。因此，你的努力得到了与之共同准备的智能生命的支持和增强。在这点上，你代表了一群学习者。所以，不要认为你的努力是孤立的。不要认为你是孤独地在世界上进行内识的恢复。不要认为你不是一个学习群体的一员。随着时间的推移，当你开始认出那些与你一起准备的人时，这一点会变得更加明显。随着你的老师存在感的加深，这一点也会变得更加明显。随着你内识成果的显现，这一点甚至会对你自己变得更加明显。随着你逐渐将自己的生命视为世界大社区的一部分，这一点也会变得更加明显。</p><p>Remind yourself of your practice upon the hour. In your deeper practices in stillness, receive the benefit of all who practice with you. Remind yourself that you are not alone and that their rewards are given to you as your rewards are given to them. Thus, you share in your accomplishments together. The power of your undertaking is so tremendously supported by the endeavor and the giving of others that it far exceeds your own abilities. When this is realized, it will give you all manner of encouragement and will banish forever the idea that you are inadequate to the tasks that are given to you. For your giving is supplemented by the giving of others, and this represents the Will of God in the universe.</p><p>提醒自己每时每刻都在练习。在更深入的静心练习中，接受所有与你一起练习的内识学生的益处。提醒自己，你并不孤单，他们给你的回报也是你给他们的回报。因此，你们共同分享成就。他人的努力和付出会极大地支持你的事业，使其远远超出你自身的能力。当你意识到这一点时，你就会得到各种鼓励，并永远消除自己不足以完成任务的想法。因为你的给予得到了他人的补充，这代表了上帝在宇宙中的意志。</p><p>Practice 170: Two 30-minute practice periods.

This I know."></a>Step 169 The world is within me. This I know.</h2><p>The world is within you. You can feel it. Through Knowledge you can feel the presence of all relationships. This is the experience of God. This is why your meaningful relationships with other individuals hold such great promise, for in genuine union with another you can begin to experience union with all life. This is why you genuinely seek relationships. This is your true motivation in relationships—to experience union and to express your purpose. People think that their relationships are to fulfill their fantasies and to fortify themselves against their own anxiety. This must be unlearned so that the true purpose of relationships may be revealed and comprehended. Thus, unlearning comes first in the process of learning. In this, you learn how to learn. In this, you learn how to receive.</p><p>世界就在你的内心深处。你能感受到它。通过内识，你能感受到所有关系的存在。这就是上帝的体验。这就是为什么你与其他人的有意义的关系具有如此伟大的承诺，因为在与他人的真正结合中，你可以开始体验与所有生命的结合。这就是你真正寻求关系的原因。这是你在关系中的真实动机——体验结合，表达你的目的。人们认为，关系是为了满足自己的幻想，是为了强化自己，抵御自己的焦虑。你必须摒弃这种想法，这样才能揭示和理解关系的真实目的。因此，在学习的过程中，首先要解除学习。在这个过程中，你学会了如何学习。在这个过程中，你学会了如何接受。</p><p>Practice upon the hour this day, remembering your idea. Today in your deeper meditations, once again use the word RAHN to take you deeper into the depth of Knowledge. Repeat the idea at the beginning of your practice and then, upon each exhale, repeat the word RAHN quietly to yourself. Allow this to center your mind. Allow this to connect you with the depth of Knowledge. Here you go deeper than you have gone before. In this, you will find all that you seek, and there will be no confusion about the world.</p><p>在今天的每个小时中，记住你的想法，进行练习。今天，在深入冥想时，再次使用RAHN这个词，带你深入内识。在开始练习时，重复这个想法，然后在每次呼气时，对自己轻声重复RAHN这个词。使你的心灵集中。让它将你与内识的深度连接起来。在这里，你会走得比以前更深。在这里，你会找到你所寻求的一切，对世界也不会感到困惑。</p><p>Practice 169: Two 30-minute practice periods.

Review each lesson as it was given and each practice that you experienced. Review the entire week so that you may fortify the learning that you are now undertaking. Remember that you are learning to learn. Remember that you are a beginning student of Knowledge. Remember that your evaluation, if it is not born of Knowledge, will not be helpful. Without this evaluation, it will be apparent how to strengthen your involvement, how to strengthen your preparation and how to make adjustments in your outer life to support you in your endeavor. This can be done without self-condemnation. It can be done because it is necessary, and you are able to respond to that which is necessary without punishing yourself or the world. This preparation is necessary, for it represents your will.</p><p>回顾过去的一周。回顾所学的每一课和所经历的每一次练习。回顾整个一周，这样你就能巩固现在正在进行的学习。记住，你是为了学习而学习。记住你是内识的初学者。记住，如果你的评价不是源于内识，那么它将不会有任何帮助。没有这种评估，如何加强你的参与，如何加强你的准备，如何调整你的外在生活以支持你的努力就会显而易见。这样做时不必自责。你可以这样做，因为这是必要的，而且你能够对必要的事情做出反应，而不会惩罚自己或这个世界。这种准备是必要的，因为它代表了你的意志。</p><p>In your long practice period today, review the week with sincerity and depth. Give this your full attention so that you may receive the gifts that you are now preparing to receive.</p><p>在今天漫长的练习中，真诚而深入地回顾这一周。全神贯注，这样你才能收到现在准备接受的礼物。</p><p>Practice 168: One long practice period.</p><p>练习 168 ：一段漫长的练习期</p>]]></content>

You are free to join. You are free to leave. You are free to make agreements. You are free to complete and change agreements. You are free to surrender yourself. You are free to extricate yourself. In Knowledge you are free.</p><p>有了内识，你在世界上是自由的。你可以自由加入。你可以自由离开。你可以自由地达成协议。你有完成和改变协议的自由。你有交出自己的自由。你可以自由解脱。在内识中，你是自由的。</p><p>In order for you to comprehend the true meaning of this and to realize its immediate value to you in your current circumstances, you must understand that you cannot use Knowledge to fulfill yourself. That must be a tacit understanding. Never lose sight of this, for if you think you are using Knowledge to fulfill yourself, you will misinterpret Knowledge and will not experience it. You will merely attempt to fortify your illusions and your attempts at escape. This can only darken the clouds that are now cast over you. This can only disappoint you as a form of temporary stimulation and compound your sense of isolation and misery.</p><p>为了让你理解这句话的真正含义，并意识到它在你当前情况下对你的直接价值，你必须明白，你不能用内识来实现你自己。这必须是一种默契。千万不要忽视这一点，因为如果你认为自己是在利用内识来实现自我，你就会曲解内识，也就无法体验内识。你只会试图强化自己的幻想和逃避的企图。这只会让现在笼罩在你们头上的乌云更加阴暗。这只会让你失望，成为一种暂时的刺激，加剧你的孤独感和痛苦感。</p><p>In Knowledge you are free. There is no restraint now, for Knowledge will merely give you where you are intended to be given and express itself through you where it is intended to be expressed. This will free you from all inappropriate involvements and engagements and will lead you to those individuals who are waiting for you. This will lead you to those circumstances that are for your greatest benefit and for the benefit of others who are involved. Here Knowledge is the guide. Here you are the recipient. Here you are the contributor. There is no greater freedom than this, for in this you are free.</p><p>在内识中，你是自由的。现在没有束缚，因为内识只会在你想要被给予的地方给予你，并通过你在它想要表达的地方表达它自己。这将把你从所有不恰当的参与和约定中解放出来，并将把你引向那些等待着你的人。这将把你引向那些对你最有利的环境，以及对其他参与者有利的环境。在这里，内识是向导。在这里，你是接受者。在这里，你是贡献者。没有比这更大的自由了，因为在这里你是自由的。</p><p>Remind yourself of this idea upon the hour, and in your two deeper meditation practices, once again enter into stillness and silence. Once again allow your mind to be quiet, for in this you are free. Prepare yourself for your practices by repeating the idea and dedicating yourself to your practice. Without your domination, your mind will be free and will experience its own depth in Knowledge.</p><p>每到一小时，提醒自己记住这个想法，在两次更深的冥想练习中，再次进入静止和沉默。再一次让你的心灵安静下来，因为这样你才是自由的。重复这个想法，为你的练习做好准备，全身心地投入练习。没有了你的主宰，你的心灵将获得自由，并在内识中体验自身的深度。</p><p>Practice 167: Two 30-minute practice periods.

      <title>第一百六十六阶：我的使命是伟大的。因此，我可以自由地做小事。</title>
      <link href="/2024/09/08/166/"/>
      <url>/2024/09/08/166/</url>
      
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Step-166-My-mission-is-great-Therefore-I-am-free-to-do-small-things"><a href="#Step-166-My-mission-is-great-Therefore-I-am-free-to-do-small-things" class="headerlink" title="Step 166  My mission is great. Therefore, I am free to do small things."></a>Step 166  My mission is great. Therefore, I am free to do small things.</h2><p>It is only in your grandiose ideas, which are a cover for fear, anxiety and despair, that you would avoid the small things that are required of you to do in the world. Again, do not confuse the greatness of your mission with the smallness of your duties. Greatness expresses itself in the smallest thing, in the tiniest action, in the most fleeting thought, in the simplest gesture and in the most mundane circumstances. Thus, maintain your small actions in the world so that Knowledge in time may express itself through them. Actions in the world are small in contrast to the greatness of Knowledge. Prior to your preparation, the world was considered great and Knowledge small, but you are now learning that the opposite is true—that Knowledge is great and the world is small. This also means that your activities in the world are small, but they are vehicles through which Knowledge may express itself.</p><p>只有在你的宏伟想法中，你才会回避在这个世界上需要你做的小事，而这些想法只是恐惧、焦虑和绝望的幌子。同样，不要把你使命的伟大与你职责的渺小混为一谈。伟大体现在最微小的事情中，体现在最细微的行动中，体现在最短暂的感想中，体现在最简单的姿态中，体现在最平凡的环境中。因此，保持你在世界上的微小行动，以便及时内识可以通过它们表达自己。与内识的伟大相比，世间的行动是渺小的。在你做好准备之前，世界被认为是伟大的，而内识是渺小的，但你现在正学习的事实恰恰相反——内识是伟大的，而世界是渺小的。这也意味着，你在世界上的活动是渺小的，但它们是内识表达自身的载体。</p><p>Therefore, be content doing small things in the world. Be simple and humble in the world so that greatness may flow through you without obstruction.</p><p>因此，要满足于在世界上做小事。在这个世界上要简单、谦逊，这样伟大的力量才能在你身上畅通无阻。</p><p>This practice will require repetition upon the hour and deep consideration in your two longer practice periods, where you will engage your mind actively in comprehending the meaning of today’s idea. Use your mind for investigation. Allow yourself to consider these things. Do not rely on conclusions but continue your exploration. This is the right use of your mind which will lead you to a greater understanding. Here the mind is not merely weaving visions and illusions to take itself away from its own anxiety. Here the mind is examining its own content. Here the mind is working on behalf of Knowledge, as it was intended to do.</p><p>这种练习需要在一小时内反复练习，并在两个较长的练习时间内进行深入思考，在这段时间内，你将积极调动你的心灵来理解今天的想法的含义。用你的心灵去探究。让自己考虑这些事情。不要依赖结论，而是继续探索。这是对心灵的正确运用，它将引导你加深理解。在这里，心灵不仅仅是在编织幻象和虚幻，以摆脱自身的焦虑。在这里，心灵正在审视自身的内容。在这里，心灵代表内识工作，这是它的本意。</p><p>Practice 166: Two 30-minute practice periods.

My mission is great."></a>Step 165  My duties are small. My mission is great.</h2><p>Your duties in the world are small. They are meant to secure provisions which you need physically  and to maintain those alliances with others that are beneficial for your well-being and for their well-being as well. These duties are important, but your mission is greater. Do not undermine your ability to receive your mission by being in failure concerning your duties. This is only a form of self-avoidance. Carry out your duties specifically this day regarding your employment and your engagement with others. Do not confuse this with your mission, which is something far greater that you are only now beginning to receive and to experience. Thus, your duties will provide a foundation for you as you undertake the preparation for the reclamation and the contribution of Knowledge.</p><p>你在这个世界上的职责很小。它们的目的是确保你身体所需的供给，并与他人保持有利于你和他人福祉的联盟。这些职责固然重要，但你的使命更为重大。不要因为失职而影响你完成使命的能力。这只是一种自我逃避。今天，你要具体履行你的职责，包括工作和与他人的交往。不要把这与你的使命混为一谈，你的使命远比你现在才开始接受和体验的要伟大得多。因此，你的职责将为你进行开垦和贡献内识的准备工作奠定基础。</p><p>Remember that all confusion is the confusion of different levels. Do not confuse mission with duty. This is a very important distinction for you to make. Your tasks in the world are specific, but your mission is far greater. As your mission begins to express itself within you who are learning to receive it, it will create a more specific influence upon your duties as well. This is gradual and entirely natural for you. This merely requires that you be self-disciplined, consistent and trusting enough to follow its steps.</p><p>请记住，所有的困惑都是不同层级的困惑。不要混淆使命与责任。这是一个非常重要的区别。你在这个世界上的任务是具体的，但你的使命要伟大得多。当你的使命开始在学习接受它的你身上表现出来时，它也会对你的职责产生更具体的影响。这对你来说是渐进的，也是完全自然的。这只需要你自律、坚持不懈、足够信任地跟随它的脚步。</p><p>Therefore, carry out your duties today so that you may be a beginning student of Knowledge. Remind yourself of your practice upon the hour, and in your two longer practice periods, actively engage your mind in considering the idea for today. Its true meaning is not superficial, and you must investigate it to understand its full value. Do not be complacent with premature conclusions. Do not stand on the outside of Knowledge and attempt to judge it for yourself. Enter into it so that you may be a student today, for you are now a student of Knowledge. You are now giving yourself to the world in your preparation.</p><p>因此，履行你今天的职责，让自己成为一名内识的初学者。提醒自己每时每刻都要进行练习，在两次较长时间的练习中，积极地让自己的心灵思考今天的想法。它的真实含义并不肤浅，你必须对它进行研究，才能理解它的全部价值。不要自满于过早的结论。不要站在内识的外面，试图自己去评判它。进入其中，这样你今天就可以成为一名学生，因为你现在是一名内识的学生。在准备过程中，您正在将自己奉献给世界。</p><p>Practice 165: Two 30-minute practice periods. Hourly practice.</p><p>练习 165： 两个 30 分钟的练习时段。每小时练习。</p>]]></content>

Upon the hour, feel Knowledge today. Repeat the idea for the day and take a moment to feel its presence. The presence of Knowledge is something you can take with you everywhere you go, into each encounter, into each circumstance. It is appropriate everywhere. In this, you will be able to see each circumstance and event. You will be able to hear. You will be able to give. You will be able to comprehend. This stability is something the world greatly needs, and you who are rich with Knowledge have this to give.</p><p>感受内识持久的品质，它随时都在你的感想和自我专注之外。每小时，感受今天的内识。重复今天的想法，花点时间感受它的存在。内识的存在是你可以随身携带的礼物，无论你走到哪里，无论你遇到什么，无论你身处什么环境。它无处不在。这样，你就能看到每个环境和事件。你将能够倾听。你将能够给予。你将能够理解。这种稳定是世界非常需要的，而你们这些内识丰富的人就能给予这种稳定。</p><p>Feel Knowledge this day in your deeper practice periods. Give yourself to this, for this is your gift to God and to the world. Let this day be a day of strengthening and a day of confirmation. Let not any small failure today dissuade you from your greater task. Realize that all setbacks can only stop you in your progress, and you need only step forward to continue.

When you begin to feel its effects, in whatever manner that it exerts its influence upon you, withdraw from it and claim your allegiance to Knowledge. Give your confidence to Knowledge.

Learn more of the process of learning. Realize that to learn this you cannot view your life with condemnation, for you are learning to learn. Realize that wealth is apparent in your life because of the practices that you are undertaking, which you could not do if you were without Knowledge. You are undertaking this preparation because of Knowledge, and each day you are committed to your practice because of Knowledge. Each day you accomplish your practice because of Knowledge. Thus, without your denial or interference, Knowledge itself will guide you in your preparation and will emerge as you undertake each step. How easy is success in this way. How simple it is to receive without denial or insistence on your part. For without imagination, life is evident. Its beauty is evident. Its grace is evident. Its purpose is evident. The work that it requires is evident. Its rewards are evident. Even the difficulties of this world are evident. Everything becomes evident as your mind becomes still and clear.</p><p>在今天的回顾中，回顾过去一周的每节课和每天的练习。进一步了解学习的过程。认识到要学会这些，你就不能用谴责的眼光看待自己的生活，因为你是在学习中学习。认识到财富在你的生命中是显而易见的，因为你正在进行的实践，如果没有内识，你是做不到的。因为有了内识，你才会进行这种准备，因为有了内识，你才会每天致力于实践。因为内识，你每天都在完成自己的练习。因此，不用你否认或干涉，内识本身就会指导你进行准备，并在你进行每一步时浮现出来。这样，成功是多么容易。无需否认，无需坚持，接纳是多么简单。因为没有想象，生命是显而易见的。它的美丽显而易见。它的恩典显而易见。它的目的显而易见。它所要求的工作显而易见。它的回报是显而易见的。甚至这个世界的困难也是显而易见的。当你的心灵变得沉静和清澈时，一切都变得显而易见。</p><p>Therefore, in one long practice period review the week’s practices.

Regardless of your circumstances, this is true because you are reclaiming the wealth of Knowledge. Understand, then, the meaning of impoverishment. Understand, then, the meaning of wealth. Do not think that those who possess more objects than you are in any way wealthier than you are, for without Knowledge they are impoverished and will acquire things only to offset their misery and uncertainty. Thus, their impoverishment is compounded by their acquisition.</p><p>世界是贫穷的，但你并不贫穷。无论你的境遇如何，这都是真实的，因为你正在开垦内识的财富。因此，请理解贫穷的含义。然后，请理解财富的含义。不要认为那些比你拥有更多物品的人在任何方面都比你富有，因为没有内识，他们是贫穷的，获得物品只是为了抵消他们的痛苦和不确定性。因此，他们的贫穷会因为他们的获取而加剧。</p><p>The world is poor, but you are not, for you have brought Knowledge with you into the world where Knowledge has been forgotten and denied. Thus, in the reclamation of your own wealth, the world will reclaim its wealth as well, for you shall stimulate Knowledge in all, and their wealth will begin to reveal itself in your presence and in the presence of Knowledge which guides you.</p><p>世界是贫穷的，但你不是，因为你把内识带入了这个内识被遗忘和否认的世界。因此，在开垦你自己的财富时，世界也将开垦它的财富，因为你将激发所有人的内识，他们的财富将在你和引导你的内识面前开始显现。</p><p>Therefore, do not ask anything of the world save what few material things you need to fulfill your function.

And if your demands are not in excess of what you need, the world will gladly render them to you in exchange for a greater gift which you possess.</p><p>因此，除了履行职责所需的一些物质条件外，不要向世界索取任何东西。与你所要付出的相比，这是微不足道的要求。如果你的要求没有超出你的需求，世界会很乐意将它们提供给你，以换取你所拥有的更伟大的礼物。</p><p>Consider the idea for the day upon each hour. Do not let any hour pass without this recognition. Strengthen your resolution to use each practice in all circumstances of the day so that your life may be meaningful in all of its events. In your two longer practice periods today, enter into stillness and peace to learn more of the wealth that you possess.</p><p>每个小时都要考虑今天的想法。不要让任何一个小时在没有认识到这一点的情况下流逝。加强你的决心，在一天中的所有情况下运用每一次练习，这样你的生活就会在所有事件中变得有意义。在今天两次较长时间的练习中，进入静止与和平，更多地学习你所拥有的财富。</p><p>Practice 160: Two 30-minute practice periods. Hourly practice.</p><p>练习 160： 两个 30 分钟的练习时段。每小时练习。</p>]]></content>

You are not destitute, for the gift of Knowledge is with you. Therefore, you are in a position to give, and in your giving you will realize your worth and any sense of destitution will leave you. Be confident that Knowledge will provide all material things that are truly needed by you. Though it may not provide what you wish, it will provide what you need and in the right amount. Thus, you will have what you need to contribute according to your nature and your calling in the world. But you will not be burdened with that which can only burden you. You will have exactly what you need, and the world will not burden you with its deprivation or its excesses. Thus, everything will have perfect balance. Knowledge will give to you what you need, and what you need is what you really want. You cannot yet assess your needs, for you are lost in what you want. But your needs will reveal themselves through Knowledge, and in time you will understand the nature of need and how it may be fulfilled.</p><p>穷人不能给予，因为他们一无所有。他们需要接收。你并不贫穷，因为你拥有内识的礼物。因此，你有能力给予，在给予的过程中，你将实现自己的价值，任何匮乏感都将离你而去。要相信，内识会提供你真正需要的一切物质。虽然它可能不会提供你所希望的东西，但它会提供你所需要的东西，而且是适量的。因此，你将拥有你所需要的东西，根据你的天性和你在这个世界上的使命做出贡献。但你不会被那些只会给你带来负担的东西所累。你将拥有你所需要的一切，而这个世界也不会因其匮乏或过度而给你带来负担。因此，一切都将完美平衡。内识会给你你所需要的，而你所需要的就是你真正想要的。你还无法评估自己的需求，因为你迷失在自己想要的东西中。但你的需求会通过内识显现出来，到那时，你就会理解自然的需求以及如何满足它。</p><p>You are not poor, for the gift of Knowledge is with you. Repeat today’s statement upon the hour and consider it in light of your observations of others. In your deeper practice periods, allow yourself to experience the wealth of Knowledge that you now possess.</p><p>你并不贫穷，因为内识的礼物与你同在。每时每刻重复今天的陈述，并结合你对他人的观察加以思考。在深入练习时，让自己体验现在所拥有的丰富内识。</p><p>Practice 159: Two 30-minute practice periods.

You possess a wealth of Knowledge already, and this is the greatest possible gift. Any other action, any other favor, any other object that is a gift is only meaningful insofar as it is imbued with Knowledge. This is the unseen essence of all true gifts and all true giving. You have a great storehouse of this essence, which you must learn to receive. You are rich beyond your own awareness. Even if you are financially poor, even if you think you are alone, you are rich. Your giving will demonstrate this today. Your giving will demonstrate the source, the depth and the meaning of your wealth and will imbue all of your giving with the essence of giving itself. You will find in time that you will give without trying and that your life itself will be a gift. Then your life will demonstrate the wealth that each person possesses but which they have not yet learned to receive.</p><p>你很富有，你可以给予。你已经拥有了健康的内识，这就是最大的礼物。任何其他行动、任何其他恩惠、任何其他作为礼物的物品，只有在被内识所浸润的情况下才是有意义的。这是所有真实的礼物和所有真实的给予所看不到的实质。你拥有一个伟大的宝库，你必须学会打开它。你的富有超出了自己的觉知。即使你经济拮据，即使你认为自己孤身一人，你也是富有的。今天，你的捐赠将证明这一点。你的给予将证明你财富的来源、深度和意义，并将使你的所有给予都充满给予本身的实质。久而久之，你就会发现，你会不遗余力地给予，你的生命本身就是一份礼物。这样，你的生命就会展现出每个人都拥有但尚未学会收到的财富。</p><p>Repeat this idea upon the hour, and in your two longer meditation practices, experience your own wealth.

You are not alone in the universe  because your mind is joined with all minds. You are not alone in the universe because the universe is with you. You are now learning to be with the universe so that your relationship with life may be fully reclaimed and so that it may express itself in your world. The world sets a poor example for this, for humanity has lost its relationship with life and now seeks desperately within the realms of imagination and fantasy to find that which has been lost. Be happy today, then, that the means for life’s reclamation have been given to you so that you may give yourself to your practice and to your destiny. In this way, you are affirmed. You are not alone in the universe. The depth of this idea is far greater than what it appears to be at first. It is a statement of absolute truth, but it must be experienced to be comprehended.</p><p>你在宇宙中并不孤单，因为你是宇宙的一部分。你在宇宙中并不孤单，因为你的心灵与所有心灵相连。你在宇宙中并不孤单，因为宇宙与你同在。你现在要学习与宇宙同在，这样你与生命的关系才能得到完全恢复，这样它才能在你的世界中表达自己。这个世界在这方面树立了一个糟糕的榜样，因为人类已经失去了与生命的关系，现在拼命在想象和幻想的领域中寻找已经丢失的生命。那么，今天要高兴的是，你已经获得了重获生命的方法，从而可以将自己给予你的实践和天命。这样，你就得到了肯定。你在宇宙中并不孤单。这个想法的深度远远超过它最初的表象。这是一个绝对真理的陈述，但必须亲身经历才能理解。</p><p>Therefore, upon the hour remind yourself of this statement. Attempt to feel it in whatever circumstance you find yourself. In your two longer meditation practices, attempt to experience your complete inclusion in life. You need not think of ideas or see images, but only feel the presence of life of which you are a part. You are within life. You are immersed in life. Life is embracing you. Beyond any images the world may present, beyond any actions the world may demonstrate, you are within the loving embrace of life.</p><p>因此，每当此时，请提醒自己这句话。无论你身处何种环境，都要尝试去感受它。在两次较长时间的冥想练习中，尝试体验自己完全融入生命的感觉。你不需要思考想法或看到图像，只需要感受生命的存在，你是生命的一部分。你就在生命之中。你沉浸在生命的怀抱。生命正在拥抱你。超越世界可能呈现的任何形象，超越世界可能展示的任何行动，你正在生命之爱的怀抱中。</p><p>Practice 157: Two 30-minute practice periods.

This compounds your sense of failure, thus influencing your lack of self-trust and self-appreciation. Our lesson for today, then, is to fortify that which is genuine within you. If you are with Knowledge, Knowledge will care for all things that require your attention. Think not that anything will be left unattended to that is for your own behalf. All needs of a greater spiritual nature and of the most mundane nature as well will be met and understood by you, for there is no neglect in Knowledge. You who are accustomed to neglect, who have not used your mind properly in the past, who have not been able to see or hear the world, can now be comforted, for you need not have concern for yourself today.</p><p>自我关注是一种习惯性思维，源于消极的想象和尚未纠正的错误。这会加重你的失败感，从而影响你缺乏自我信任和自我欣赏。那么，我们今天的课程就是强化你内心的真诚。如果你与内识同在，内识就会关注所有需要你关注的事物。不要认为有什么事情会因为你自己而被忽视。所有精神层面和世俗层面的需求都会得到满足和理解，因为内识不会忽视。那些习惯于被忽视的人，那些过去没有正确使用心智的人，那些无法看到或听到这个世界的人，现在可以得到安慰了，因为你今天不需要为自己担忧。</p><p>For this you must extend your faith and your trust that Knowledge will provide for you. This in time will allow you to receive the gift of Knowledge, which will dispel all doubt and confusion. You must prepare for this experience. In this, you must extend your faith and trust. Be confident this day. Recognize those things that require your attention, even if they be of a mundane nature, and attend to them well, for Knowledge is not seeking to take you out of the world but to bring you into the world, for you have come here to give.</p><p>为此，你必须坚定信念，相信内识会为你提供帮助。假以时日，你将获得内识的礼物，它将消除所有的怀疑和困惑。你必须为此做好准备。为此，你必须坚定信念和信任。今天要充满信心。认清那些需要你关注的事情，即使是平凡的事情，也要认真对待，因为内识并不是要带你离开这个世界，而是要带你进入这个世界，因为你来到这里是为了给予。</p><p>Fortify your understanding of today’s idea by repeating it upon the hour and giving it a moment of true consideration. Fortify your practice today by utilizing it in your deeper practices where you enter stillness and silence. You can only enter stillness and silence if you are without concern for yourself. Thus, your commitment to give yourself to your practice is an affirmation of the safety and the certainty that abide with you.</p><p>通过每时每刻重复今天的想法，并给予它片刻真正的思考，来加强你对它的理解。在你进入静止和沉默的深入练习中使用它，加强你今天的练习。只有当你不关心自己时，你才能进入静止和沉默。因此，你为自己的实践付出的承诺，就是对与你同在的安全感和确定性的肯定。</p><p>Practice 156: Two 30-minute practice periods.

It is not merely the sharing of little ideas from one separated mind to another. Communication is far greater, for communication creates life and extends life, and within this is all joy and fulfillment. Within this is the depth of all meaning. Here darkness and light mix together and cease their separation. Here all opposites blend and melt into each other. This is the unity of all life.</p><p>你被创造出来，就是为了表达你的本源。你被创造出来，就是为了成为本源的延伸。你被创造出来，就是为了成为你的本源的一部分。你的生命就是交流，因为交流就是生命。交流是内识的延伸。它不仅仅是一个分离的心灵与另一个分离的心灵分享一些想法。交流远不止于此，因为交流创造了生命，延伸了生命，其中蕴含着所有的喜悦和满足。这就是一切意义的深度所在。在这里，黑暗与光明混合在一起，不再分离。在这里，所有的对立面都相互融合，融为一体。这就是所有生命的统一。</p><p>Allow yourself, then, to experience yourself as a vehicle of communication, and know what you truly wish to communicate will be fully expressed as well, for the self that you genuinely are is an extension of the Self that is life itself.

It should be investigating. Do not rely upon early conclusions. Do not rely upon self-comforting ideas. Allow yourself to be vulnerable today, for you are only vulnerable to Knowledge. Yet Knowledge will shield you from all things of harm within this world and will provide a comfort and a stability that the world can never change. Learn of this today so that you may be a source of Knowledge within the world so that your Source may express itself through you.</p><p>每隔一小时重复一次你今天的想法，并结合你今天所经历的一切进行思考。在两次较长时间的练习中，积极运用你的心灵，尝试理解今天的课程。同样，这也是心灵运用的一种形式。我们今天要练习的不是静止和心静，而是心灵的运用，这样你才能学会建设性地思考。因为当你的心灵不保持静心时，它应该是在进行建设性的思考。它应该进行研究。不要依赖过早的结论。不要依赖自我安慰的想法。今天，请允许自己变得脆弱，因为你只对内识脆弱。然而，内识会保护你免受世间万物的伤害，并为你提供世界永远无法改变的安慰和稳定。今天就学习这些，让你成为世界上的内识源泉，让你的源泉通过你来表达它自己。</p><p>Practice 152: Two 30-minute practice periods.

As you withdraw from them, you will realize that their source is fear, for you have only been trying to comfort yourself with your judgments, to provide a false security, stability and identity which you feel you are lacking. Therefore, be without a substitute for Wisdom and Knowledge, and allow Wisdom and Knowledge to arise naturally.</p><p>不要用恐惧来支持你对自己和世界的判断，因为这些判断源于你的不确定和焦虑。因此，它们缺乏内识的基础。因此，它们缺乏只有内识才能赋予的意义和价值。不要依赖你对自己和世界的判断。当你从这些判断中抽身出来时，你就会认识到它们的根源是恐惧，因为你只是试图用你的判断来安慰自己，为自己提供一种虚假的安全感、稳定感和认同感，而这正是你所缺乏的。因此，不要让智慧和内识代替你，让智慧和内识自然产生。</p><p>Upon the hour repeat your statement, and consider it in light of all things that are occurring today. In your two deeper practices, consider the meaning of today’s idea as you think about it carefully. Apply your mind in a state of work as you attempt to penetrate the meaning of today’s lesson. Do not be comforted by premature conclusions. Investigate deeply with your mind in your practice periods. Use your mind actively. Consider many things within yourself while maintaining a concentration on today’s idea. If you do this, you will understand many things about wisdom and ignorance, and your understanding will be born of compassion and true selfappreciation. For only from a place of self-love can you offer correction to yourself and to others.</p><p>每小时重复一次你的陈述，并结合今天发生的所有事情进行思考。在你的两次深入练习中，仔细思考今天的想法的意义。当你试图深入理解今天课程的意义时，将你的心灵运用到工作状态中。不要过早下结论。在练习期间用心深入探究。积极运用你的心灵。在专注于今天所学内容的同时，考虑自己内心的许多事情。如果你这样做了，你就会明白许多关于智慧和无知的事情，你的理解将源于同情和真正的自我欣赏。因为只有从自爱的角度出发，你才能修正自己和他人。</p><p>Practice 151: Two 30-minute practice periods. Hourly practice.</p><p>练习 151： 两个 30 分钟的练习时段。每小时练习一次。</p>]]></content>

      <title>第一百五十阶：今天我要学会学习</title>
      <link href="/2024/08/25/150/"/>
      <url>/2024/08/25/150/</url>
      
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Step-150-Today-I-will-learn-to-learn"><a href="#Step-150-Today-I-will-learn-to-learn" class="headerlink" title="Step 150  Today I will learn to learn."></a>Step 150  Today I will learn to learn.</h2><p>Today you learn to learn. You learn to learn because you need to learn. You need to learn how to learn so that your learning may be effective and expedient, have depth and consistency and produce a sound advancement that you can rely upon in all circumstances in the future. Do not think that you already understand the process of learning, for you are learning about this now as you understand the meaning of advancement, the meaning of failure, the meaning of encouragement, the meaning of discouragement, the meaning of enthusiasm and the meaning of a lack of enthusiasm. That is why at the end of each week you review your practices so that you may understand your progress and understand the mechanism of learning. This is essential for you to realize, for until you do, you will misinterpret your steps, you will misconstrue your actions, you will not understand how to follow a curriculum and you will never learn how to teach a curriculum yourself.</p><p>今天，你要学会学习。你要学会学习，因为你需要学习。你需要学会如何学习，这样你的学习才会有效而便捷，才会有深度和连贯性，才会产生稳健的进步，让你在未来的任何情况下都可以信赖。不要认为你已经理解了学习的过程，因为你现在正在学习理解进步的意义，失败的意义，鼓励的意义，沮丧的意义，热情的意义，以及缺乏热情的意义。这就是为什么在每周结束时，你需要回顾你的练习，以便理解你的进步，并理解学习的机制。这对你来说至关重要，因为直到你做到这一点，你才不会误解自己的步骤，不会误解自己的行动，才能理解如何遵循课程，并最终学会如何自己教授课程。</p><p>Therefore, today you learn to learn. This places you as a beginning student of Knowledge, which gives you all rights and all encouragement to learn everything that is necessary, without presumption, without conceit, without denial and without falsity of any kind. As you learn to learn, you will realize the mechanism of learning. This will give you wisdom and compassion in your dealings with people. You cannot teach people from idealism, for then you place upon them the burden of your own expectations. You require of them what even life cannot provide. But the certainty of your experience and your Knowledge, which you will give to others, will be sound, and they will be able to receive it and utilize it in their own way. Then you will not place any personal demands upon them in their learning, but will allow Knowledge within you to give to Knowledge in them. You will then be a witness to the instruction and to the learning as well. </p><p>因此，今天你要学会学习。这使你成为内识的初学者，并赋予你一切权利和鼓励，让你学习一切必要的知识，不妄自菲薄，不自负，不否认，不虚假。当你学会学习时，你就会认识到学习的机制。这将赋予你待人接物的智慧和同情。你不能从理想主义出发去教导别人，因为这样你就把自己的期望强加给了他们。你对他们的要求是生命所不能提供的。但是，你所传授给他人的经验和内识是可靠的，他们能够接受并以自己的方式加以使用。这样，你就不会对他们的学习提出任何个人要求，而是让你内在的内识给予他们内在的内识。这样，你也就成为了教学和学习的见证人。</p><p>Therefore, today bear witness to your own learning and learn to learn. Upon the hour, remind yourself that you are learning to learn. In your two meditation practices, allow yourself to enter stillness and peace. Observe yourself as you move forward and as you hold yourself back. Exert your will on your own behalf compassionately and firmly, and judge not your advancement because you are not in a position to judge, because you are learning to learn.</p><p>因此，今天要见证自己的学习，学会学习。每时每刻，都要提醒自己，你正在学会学习。在两次冥想练习中，让自己进入静止与平和。观察自己的前进和退缩。同情而坚定地代表自己行使意志，不要评判自己的进步，因为你没有资格评判，因为你正在学习。</p><p>Practice 150: Two 30-minute practice periods. Hourly practice.</p><p>练习 150 ：两个30分钟的练习时段。每小时的练习。</p>]]></content>

Thus, each day that you undertake the practice according to each step that is given, you give a gift to the world. Why is this? It is because you acknowledge your value and your worth. You acknowledge your Ancient Home and your Ancient Destiny. You acknowledge those who sent you and those who will receive you when you leave this world. All this is given to the world each time you practice sincerely, upon each day, upon each hour. This is a greater gift to the world than you can yet understand, but in time you will see the total need that it fulfills.</p><p>此时此刻，你通过自身的发展为世界做出了贡献，因为你正准备送出比以往任何时候都更大的礼物。因此，你按照每一个步骤进行练习的每一天，都是给世界的礼物。这是为什么呢？因为你承认了自己的价值和身价。你承认自己的古老家园和古老天命。你承认那些送你来到这里的存在，以及当你离开这个世界时将会接待你的存在。每当你真诚地练习时，每一天，每一个小时，这一切都会给予这个世界。这是给世界的更大的礼物，你还无法理解，但随着时间的推移，你会看到它所满足的全部需求。</p><p>Therefore, your practice is a gift to the world, for it gives that which you are affirming within yourself. What you affirm within yourself you affirm for all individuals, in all circumstances, in all worlds and in all dimensions. Thus, you affirm the reality of Knowledge. Thus, you affirm your Ancient Home while you are here.</p><p>因此，你的练习是给世界的礼物，因为它给予了你内心所肯定的内识。你对自己的肯定，就是对所有个体、所有环境、所有世界和所有维度的肯定。因此，你肯定了内识的真实性。因此，当你在这里时，你就肯定了你的古老家园。</p><p>Upon the hour, give to the world through your practice of giving. Remind yourself of this. In your two longer practice periods, give yourself completely into stillness and silence. Give of your heart and give of your mind. Give all that you realize you can give, for this is a gift to the world. Though you cannot as yet see the result, have confidence that this giving will extend beyond your own mind and will touch all minds in the universe, for all minds are truly joined in reality.</p><p>每个小时，通过你给予的练习来回馈世界。提醒自己这一点。在你的两个较长的练习期间，完全投入到宁静与静默中。用你的心去给予，用你的心灵去给予。给予你认识到的所有你能给予的内识，因为这是给世界的礼物。虽然你还无法看到结果，但要有信心，这种给予会超越你自己的心灵并触及宇宙中所有的心灵，因为所有的心灵在现实中是真正连接在一起的。</p><p>Practice 149: Two 30-minute practice periods.

Thus, you are honored as the recipient and as the vehicle for Knowledge, God is honored as the source of Knowledge, and all who receive it will be honored as well. This is your gift now—to undertake the true preparation that you are involved in currently.</p><p>你的练习是你献给上帝的礼物，因为上帝希望你能够获得内识，以便你可以将其传递给世界。因此，作为内识的接收者和传播者，你将受到尊敬，上帝作为内识的源头也将受到尊敬，而所有收到内识的人也将受到尊敬。这是你现在的礼物——参与你当前正在进行的真实准备。</p><p>Therefore, treat each practice period today as a form of giving. Upon the hour, give yourself in each circumstance in which you find yourself. In your two deep meditation practices, give yourself completely. Do not come begging for ideas or information, but come to receive and come to give. As you give yourself, you will receive and in this you will learn the ancient law that to give is to receive. This must be born completely in your experience so that you may fully comprehend its meaning and its application in the world.</p><p>因此，今天要把每个练习时段视为一种给予的形式。在每个整点，给出你自己，在你所处的每个情境中。在两次深入冥想的练习中，完全地给予你自己。不要来乞求想法或信息，而是来接收和给予。当你给予你自己时，你就会收到，在此过程中你将学习到古老的法则——给予即是收到。这必须完全在你的体验中得以印证，以便你能够充分理解它的意义及其在世界中的应用。</p><p>Your practice is your gift to God. Your practice is your gift to yourself. Come to your practice today to give, for in your giving you will realize the depth of your own resources.</p><p>你的练习是你献给上帝的礼物。你的练习也是你给自己的礼物。今天带着给予的心态来进行练习，因为在你的给予中，你将认识到自己资源的深度。</p><p>Practice 148: Two 30-minute practice periods.

Take special care to recognize the empowerment that is being offered to you as you exert your will for good. Note as well the requirement that you accept yourself beyond your current understanding, that you honor yourself beyond your current evaluation of yourself and that you experience life beyond your own thoughts and prejudices. Recognize the opportunity that is being given to you, and realize that each moment that you spend in sincere application furthers your progress tremendously and establishes a permanent advancement for you. If you think of what you would want to give to the world, give your advancement.

In your two meditations, practice keeping your mind steady and focused, allowing it to settle into itself so that it may experience its own nature. Do not repress what is occurring within you. Do not control what is occurring without. Simply maintain consistency, and all things will find a right balance and relationship to this. Thus, you are bringing forth Knowledge into the world, for Knowledge is entirely consistent. This will render you a person of great presence and power. Others will come to experience your consistency in time as it is more fully received by you and more fully developed. They will find refuge in your consistency, and this will remind them of their purpose as well, which waits to be discovered.</p><p>因此，今天请保持一致。在每个整点，提醒自己要保持一致。在你的两次冥想中，练习保持你的心灵平静和专注，让它自然地安定下来，以便它能够体验到自己的自然。不要压抑你内在发生的事情，也不要控制外在发生的事情。只需保持一致，所有事物都会找到与这一点的正确平衡和关系。因此，你将内识带入了世界，因为内识是完全一致的。这将使你成为一个具有巨大存在感和力量的人。随着你的这种一致性被更充分地接纳和更充分地发展，其他人也将会感受到你的这种一致性。他们将在你的这种一致性中找到庇护，这也会提醒他们自身的目的，这一目的正在等待被发现。</p><p>Practice 142: Two 30-minute practice periods. Hourly practice.</p><p>练习 142 ：两个 30 分钟的练习时段。每小时练习一次。</p>]]></content>

You have come this far, and from here you will proceed on with greater strength and certainty, for Knowledge will begin to guide you and to motivate you increasingly as you become attentive to it. You wish to be the servant and the Master all at once because the servant is in you and the Master is in you. You personally are not the Master, but the Master is in you. You personally are a servant, but you are in relationship with the Master, and so your union is complete. Thus, all aspects of yourself find their rightful place. All things are brought into alignment and harmony with one purpose and one goal. Your life is simple because it is in harmony and in balance. Knowledge will indicate all things that must be done for you—physically, emotionally and mentally—to develop this balance and to maintain it in your current circumstances. Think not that any vital aspect will be overlooked or left undone.</p><p>今天，你完成了二十周的练习。你已经走到了这一步，从这里开始，你将以更大的力量和信心继续前进，因为内识将开始引导你，并随着你对内识的关注而越来越多地激励你。你希望同时成为服务者和大师，因为服务者在你的里面，大师也在你里面。你本人不是大师，但大师在你的里面。你本人是服务者，但你与大师有关系，因此你们的结合是完整的。这样，你自身的方方面面都找到了自己应有的位置。万事万物都与一个目的、一个目标保持一致与和谐。你的生活是简单的，因为它是和谐的、平衡的。内识会为你指出所有必须做的事情——在身体上、情感上和心理上——以发展这种平衡，并在你当前的环境中保持这种平衡。不要认为任何重要方面都会被忽视或遗漏。</p><p>Congratulations for your accomplishment thus far. Review the past six days of practice and gauge your understanding of your progress appropriately. Allow yourself to be a beginning student of Knowledge so that you may receive the very most. You will proceed on from here with greater certainty and speed and greater involvement as well as you learn to utilize all things for your benefit.</p><p>祝贺你迄今为止所取得的成就。回顾过去六天的练习，适当衡量自己对进步的理解。让自己成为内识的初学者，这样你才能获得最大的收获。当你学会善用万事万物为自己谋福利时，你将会更有把握、更快、更投入地继续前进。</p><p>Practice 140: One long practice period.</p><p>练习 140 ：一段漫长的练习期</p>]]></content>

First, you must unlearn what you have  taught yourself so that you may reclaim that which you have brought with you. This preparation is essential for your success and for your happiness as well. Do not think that through understanding alone you will be able to recognize and give your true gifts. Your participation is your preparation, for you are being prepared to participate in life. Thus, We draw you more and more into the mystery of life and the manifestation of life. In this way, you will be able to treat the mystery as mysterious with wonder, and you will be able to treat the manifestation of life practically and with objectivity. With this, you will be able to be a bridge from your Ancient Home to the manifest world. Across this bridge, the Wisdom of Knowledge may express itself, and you may find your greatest fulfillment.</p><p>你来到这个世界是为了服务，但首先你必须接收内识。首先，你必须忘却你自己教给自己的经验，以便你能够重新获得你随身携带的内识。这一准备对于你的成功和幸福至关重要。不要认为仅凭理解你就能够识别并给予你真正的礼物。你的参与就是你的准备，因为你正被准备着去参与生命。因此，我们引导你越来越深入地进入生命的神秘和表现形式。通过这种方式，你将能够以敬畏之心对待神秘，同时能够以实事求是和客观的态度对待生命的表现形式。这样，你将能够成为从你古老家园到显现世界的桥梁。通过这座桥，内识的智慧可以得以表达，而你也将找到你最大的满足。</p><p>Practice your RAHN meditation twice today with great depth and concentration, and remember your idea upon the hour so that you may utilize all occurrences today on your own behalf.</p><p>今天要深入、专注地练习两次RAHN冥想，并在每小时记住这个想法，这样你就能善用今天发生的一切来为你自己服务。</p><p>Practice 139: Two 30-minute practice periods.

To not participate and to attempt to understand is utterly fruitless, utterly frustrating and without a happy or satisfying result of any kind. We are preparing you to participate in life, not to judge it, for life will hold a greater promise than your judgments could ever reveal. Your understanding is born of participation and is the result of participation. Thus, learn to participate and then to understand, for this is the true sequence of things.</p><p>如果你回想自己曾通过简单地遵循预备步骤而学到的许多事，这个事实是如此显而易见。不参与其中而试图理解是完全没有结果的，完全令人沮丧的，而且不会带来任何快乐或满足的结果。我们正在准备你参与生命，而不是去评判它，因为生命中蕴藏的希望远比你的评判所能揭示的要大得多。你的理解是通过参与产生的，是参与的结果。因此，学会参与，然后再理解，因为这是学习的真实顺序。</p><p>This day remember your hourly practices and allow your two meditations in stillness to become deeper. Allow no thoughts of fear, anxiety or self-doubt to dissuade you from your greater activity. Your ability to practice regardless of your emotional state demonstrates that the presence of Knowledge is within you, for Knowledge is beyond all emotional states and is unfettered by them. If you wish to see the stars, you must look beyond the clouds. What are your fears but clouds that pass through your mind? They only change the character of the surface of your mind, but the depth of your mind remains unchanged forever.</p><p>今天，记住每小时的练习，并让你在静心中进行的两次冥想变得更加深入。不要让任何恐惧、焦虑或自我怀疑的念头阻碍你进行更伟大的活动。无论你的情绪状态如何，能够坚持练习就证明了内识的存在，因为内识超越了所有情绪状态，不受其束缚。如果你想看到星星，你必须越过云层。你的恐惧不过是你心中飘过的云彩。它们只会改变你心灵表面的特征，但你心灵的深度永远不会改变。</p><p>Practice 138: Two 30-minute practice periods.

Your origin, your purpose here and your destination when you leave are very  mysterious. They can only be experienced to be comprehended. How can you, at this given moment, understand the mystery of your life? You would have to be at the end of your life to understand what has transpired thus far, and you are not at the end of your life in the world. You would have to see the world from your Ancient Home to understand the true meaning of the world. You are in the world now, so you must be present to the world. Yet this mystery can be experienced and must be experienced. You cannot understand it at this moment, but in this moment you can experience it fully. Within this experience, it will yield to you all of the things that you now need to take the vital step that is waiting for you to take.</p><p>你的生命是一个谜团。你的起源、你在这里的目的以及你离开时的去向都非常神秘。只有通过体验才能理解这些谜团。在此刻，你怎么能理解你生命的神秘呢？你必须在生命结束时才能理解迄今为止发生的事情，而你现在还没有走到生命的尽头。你必须从你古老的家园来看世界，才能理解世界的真正意义。而你现在身处世界之中，因此你必须对世界保持警觉。然而，这种神秘是可以体验到的，而且必须体验到。在此刻你无法理解它，但在此刻你可以完全地体验它。在这种体验中，它会向你揭示所有你现在需要的准备，以便你能迈出等待你迈出的关键一步。</p><p>Therefore, do not burden your mind with the requirement of understanding, for you will seek the impossible and will only confuse yourself and add to the burden of your thinking. Rather, give yourself to experience the mystery of your life with wonder and appreciation that the world is far greater than what your senses have reported thus far and that your life is far greater than what your judgments have determined.</p><p>因此，不要用理解的要求来给你的心灵增加负担，因为你将追求不可能的事情，只会让你自己困惑，并增加你的思考负担。相反，以惊奇和感激之情去体验你生命的神秘，因为世界远比你到目前为止感知到的要大得多，而你的生命也远比你的判断所决定的要伟大得多。</p><p>Repeat this idea upon the hour and practice your RAHN meditation twice today with great depth and sincerity. Allow your practice today to reaffirm your commitment to Knowledge, for you need only follow the steps as they are given.</p><p>每小时重复这一想法，并且今天进行两次深度和真诚的RAHN冥想练习。让你的练习作为今天重新确认你对内识的承诺，因为你只需按照给出的步骤去做。</p><p>Practice 137: Two 30-minute practice periods.

It will simply emerge, and you will understand it more deeply and more completely with each step, for each step will fulfill it even more.</p><p>这将回答你关于你目的的问题。当你追随这个目标时，你在人生中的召唤——一个你将被要求扮演的具体角色——将会一步步地自然出现。它不需要你的定义。它将会简单地浮现出来，随着每一步你会更加深刻和全面地理解它，因为每一步都会进一步实现它。</p><p>Your Knowledge is your purpose. Remind yourself of this upon the hour, and be glad that an answer has been given. But the answer is not merely an idea. It is an opportunity for preparation, for all true answers to all genuine questions are some form of preparation. It is the preparation that you require and not answers alone. Your mind is full of answers already, and what have they done but add to the burden of your thinking? Follow, then, the preparation given this day and each day within Our program so that you may receive the answer to your question.

To receive its full benefit, you need only practice it as it is given.</p><p>再次，每小时提醒自己这一确认。整天思考它，让它成为你今天理解的唯一焦点。在你的两个较长的冥想练习中，继续重复“RAHN”这个词，它将激发你内在的古老内识。你不需要理解这个练习的力量，就能获得其全部益处。为了获得其全部益处，你只需按照所给的练习进行。</p><p>Practice 136: Two 30-minute practice periods.

The more that you experience it, the closer you will want to become because this is a natural attraction. This is true love, the attraction of like to like. This is what gives the universe all of its meaning. This is what joins life together completely. Be free this day of definitions, and allow your mind to take its natural formation.

Do not give it great credibility. In this way, the world cannot anger you, for what can the world do to you but undermine your definition of yourself?

It is right thinking, right action and true motivation that will advance you naturally in the direction in which you are meant to go. Each step forward will give you a greater sense of purpose, meaning and direction in life and will free you from attempting to resolve matters that do not require resolution and from attempting to understand things out of fear and anxiety. The more at peace you are with your nature, the more your nature can express the greatness that you have brought with you. Thus, you will become a light unto all around you, and you will marvel at the events of your own life, which in itself will be a miracle.</p><p>今天我们将回顾过去一周的准备工作。客观地回顾这一点，不加谴责，再次认识到你的进步和局限性，并坚定你的决心。因为我们希望培养你对内识的渴望以及你的能力。正确的思考、正确的行动和真正的动力会自然地推动你朝着你想要去的方向前进。每向前迈出一步都会让你有一种更大的人生目标、意义和方向感，让你摆脱试图解决不需要解决的问题，也摆脱试图出于恐惧和焦虑而理解事物。你越是与你的自然性和平相处，你的自然就越能表达你所带来的伟大。因此，你将成为你周围所有人的光，你将对你自己生命中的事件感到惊讶，它本身就是一个奇迹。</p><p>In your long practice period today, undertake your review with depth and sincerity. Do not let anything dissuade you from your practice today. It is your practice that is your gift to God, for you give yourself in your practice, and you receive your gift as well.</p><p>在今天漫长的练习期间，请以深度和真诚的方式进行复习。不要让任何事情阻止你今天的练习。你的实践就是你送给上帝的礼物，因为你在练习中给予你自己，你也收到了你的礼物。</p><p>Practice 133: One long practice period.</p><p>练习 133 ：一段漫长的练习期</p>]]></content>

This is not to solidify your separation or to make it more complete, but instead to enable you to join meaningfully in relationship. Let this be a tacit understanding: You can do nothing in the world without relationship. You can accomplish nothing; you can advance in no direction; you can realize no truth; you can contribute nothing of value without relationship. So as your independence from the past grows, thus does your promise for inclusion in the present and the future grow as well. For freedom is meant to empower you to join.</p><p>摆脱过去——过去的判断、过去的联系、过去的痛苦、过去的伤害和过去的困难——使你在当下获得独立。这并不是为了巩固你的分离或使其更加完整，而是为了让你能够有意义地加入到关系中。让这成为一个默契的理解：在没有关系的情况下，你在世界上无法做任何事情。你无法完成任何事情；你无法朝任何方向前进；你无法认识任何真理；你无法贡献任何有价值的礼物。因此，随着你从过去中获得的独立性增长，你在当下和未来的包容性也随之增长。因为自由的目的是让你能够加入。</p><p>Remember this idea upon the hour and give it consideration in light of all of your experiences today. In your two meditation practices, allow the attraction of Knowledge to pull you deeper within yourself. Allow yourself to have this experience of freedom.</p><p>每小时记住这个想法，并结合你今天的所有经历来考虑。在你的两次冥想练习中，允许内识的吸引力把你拉向内心深处。让自己体验这种自由感。</p><p>Practice 132: Two 30-minute practice periods.

This provides the foundation for all meaningful relationships. Do not seek relationships outside of this context, for they will lack foundation and, though perhaps very alluring, will prove to be very difficult for you. Whether you are seeking marriage, great friendship or someone to help you in your work, remember that Knowledge will draw to you all individuals as you truly need them.</p><p>寻求真实目的的经验。这为所有有意义的关系提供了基础。在这个背景之外不要寻找关系，因为它们将缺乏基础，尽管可能非常吸引人，但对你来说可能会非常困难。无论你是在寻找婚姻、伟大的友谊还是有人帮助你完成工作，请记住，内识会将你真正需要的人带到你身边。</p><p>Therefore, today concentrate on purpose and not on relationship. The greater your experience of purpose, the greater your comprehension of relationship. Though you will see that people come together for enjoyment and stimulation, there is a far greater component in their meeting. Few people recognize this, but it is given you to recognize this through practice and experience. You can be certain that if you are not trying to fit people into your own idea of purpose, you will be opening yourself to the genuine experience of purpose itself. As you begin to observe yourself objectively, you will begin to see the manifestations of your own will in contrast to Knowledge, and this will be very essential for your learning.</p><p>因此，今天集中精力于目的而非关系。你对目的的体验越深，你对关系的理解就越深。虽然你会看到人们为了享乐和刺激而聚在一起，但他们的相遇中有一个更大的组成部分。很少有人认识到这一点，但通过练习和体验，你会被赋予认识到这一点的机会。你可以确信，如果你不是试图将人们纳入你自己对目的的理解中，你就会开放自己去体验真正的目的。当你开始客观地观察自己时，你将开始看到自己的意志与内识之间的对比，这对于你的学习将非常重要。</p><p>Today remind yourself upon the hour of your intent to realize your purpose. Let today be a step in that direction—a step that will save you years and years of time, a step that will advance you forever towards your goal of Knowledge, for Knowledge is drawing you. In your two deeper practice periods, allow Knowledge to draw you. Feel the greater attraction within you, which you will naturally feel if you are not preoccupied with little things.</p><p>今天每小时提醒自己要认识到你的目的。让今天成为朝这个方向迈出的一步——这一步将为你节省多年时间，永远推动你走向内识的目标，因为内识在吸引你。在你的两个更深层面的练习时段中，允许内识吸引你。感受你内在更强大的吸引力，如果你不被小事所困扰，你自然会感受到这种吸引力。</p><p>Practice 131: Two 30-minute practice periods. Hourly practice.</p><p>练习 131：两个30分钟的练习时段。每小时练习。</p>]]></content>

To understand this, you must have great faith in the power of Knowledge within yourself and within others. As this awareness grows, the basis for your striving and desperate pursuits will fall away, making true peace and accomplishment possible for you.</p><p>在这个世界上，为什么要为关系而努力呢？当你准备好时，真正的关系会自然而然地来到你身边。要理解这一点，你必须对内在的内识力量以及他人内在的内识力量抱有深深的信任。随着这种觉知的增长，你努力追求的基础和绝望追求的基础将会消失，真正的平和和成就才得以可能。</p><p>Individuals will come to you through mysterious means because you are cultivating Knowledge. As you have relationships with one another on a personal level, you also have relationships on the level of Knowledge. It is this level that you will begin to experience, in small increments at first. Eventually, if you pursue your preparations appropriately, this experience will grow and become quite profound for you.</p><p>个人会通过神秘的方式来到你身边，因为你正在培养内识。当你们在个人层面上建立起相互关系时，你们也在内识层面上建立起关系。你们将开始体验这个层面，起初只是小范围的。最终，如果你们的准备工作做得恰当，这种经历将会逐渐增长，并对你们产生深远的影响。</p><p>You do not need to seek for relationships. You need only give yourself to your preparation and have confidence that people will come to you when you need them. This will require that you assess your needs in contrast to your wishes. If your wishes do not represent your genuine needs, then you will confuse your life terribly. You will place a burden upon yourself and upon those with whom you are engaged that can only oppress them, and you as well. Without this oppression, people will be free to come to you as you truly need them.</p><p>你无需刻意寻求关系。你只需要全身心地投入到准备工作中，并相信在你需要他们时，人们会自然而然地来到你身边。这将要求你评估清楚自己的需求和愿望之间的差异。如果你的愿望并不代表你真正的需求，那你的生活就会非常混乱。你会给自己和与你交往的人带来负担，这种负担只会压迫他们，也会压迫你自己。没有了这种压迫，人们就可以自由地来找你，因为你真正需要他们。</p><p>Remind yourself of this upon the hour today, and in your two longer practice periods allow your mind to enter receptivity. Allow yourself to feel the presence of your Teachers. Do not exacerbate yourself with desires for relationship and your requirements for individuals or for what they may possess. Have confidence today that Knowledge will draw all people to you as you truly need them.</p><p>今天每小时都要提醒自己这一点，在两次较长时间的练习中，让自己的心灵进入接纳状态。允许自己感受到老师的存在。不要因为对关系的渴望或对个体需求的要求而使自己加剧。今天要相信，内识会在你真正需要他们时将所有人吸引到你身边</p><p>Practice 130: Two 30-minute practice periods.

They are not speaking to you except on very rare occasions, and then only  if you are capable of hearing. From time to time they will send their thoughts into your mind, and you will experience this as your own spark of inspiration. You are as yet unaware of how your mind is joined with all other minds, but in time you will begin to experience this in the context of your own world. The demonstration of this will become so obvious that you will wonder how you could ever have doubted it.</p><p>你的老师与你同在。他们不会对你说话，除非在极少数情况下，而且只有在你能够听到的情况下。他们会时不时地把他们的感想传递到你的心灵中，你会体验到这是你自己的灵感火花。你还没有察觉到你的心灵是如何与所有其他心灵结合在一起的，但随着时间的推移，你将开始在自己的世界中体验到这一点。这一点会变得如此明显，以至于你会怀疑自己怎么会对此产生怀疑。</p><p>Your Teachers are with you and today in your two longer practice periods, practice being with them. You do not need to create an image of them in order to have this experience. You do not need to hear a voice or see a face, for their presence is enough to give you a complete experience that you are in fact together. If you will be still, breathe deeply and not weave fantasies—neither happy fantasies nor fearful fantasies—you will begin to experience what is actually there. Your Teachers are actually there. And today you can practice being with them.</p><p>你的老师与你同在，今天在你两个较长的练习时间里，练习与他们在一起。你不需要为他们创造一个形象来获得这种体验。你不需要听到他们的声音，也不需要看到他们的面孔，因为他们的存在就足以让你完整地体验到你们其实是在一起的。如果你能静下心来，深呼吸，不编织幻想——无论是快乐的幻想还是恐惧的幻想——你就会开始体验到什么是真正的存在。你的老师就在这里。今天，你可以练习与他们在一起。</p><p>Practice 129: Two 30-minute practice periods.</p><p>练习 129： 两个 30 分钟的练习时段</p>]]></content>

I need not fear."></a>Step 128  My Teachers are with me. I need not fear.</h2><p>Your Inner Teachers are with you, and you need not fear. If you have sufficient confidence  in Knowledge, based upon actual experience, and sufficient confidence in the presence of your Teachers, based upon actual experience, this will give you a certainty and a faith in life that will counteract all fear that is unnecessary. This will leave your mind at ease.</p><p>你的内在老师与你同在，你无需恐惧。如果你基于实际经验，对内识有足够的信心，基于实际经验，对你老师的存在有足够的信心，这将给你带来一种确定性和对生命的信心，从而抵消一切不必要的恐惧。这会让你心安理得。</p><p>Only concern that your Knowledge is being violated will emanate from Knowledge, and then only to indicate that you need to reassess your actions and ideas. Knowledge has a self-correcting principle. That is why it is your Inner Guidance. If you are going against your Knowledge, you will be ill at ease with yourself, and this will give rise to anxiety. Much of the fear that you experience moment to moment is simply a matter of your own creation, your own negative imagination. But, then, there is fear that is born of the violation of Knowledge. This is more a discomfort than a fear, for it rarely carries with it any kind of imagery at all, though ideas can come into your mind as a form of warning should you be attempting a behavior or a line of thinking that is dangerous or destructive.</p><p>只有当你的内识受到侵犯时，内识才会发出担忧，然后才会表明你需要重新评估自己的行为和观念。内识具有自我纠正原则。这就是为什么它是你的内在指引。如果你违背了内识，你就会对自己感到不自在，从而产生焦虑。你每时每刻都在经历的恐惧，很多都是你自己制造出来的，是你自己的负面想象。但是，也有一些恐惧源于对内识的侵犯。这种恐惧与其说是恐惧，不如说是一种不适，因为它很少带有任何形式的意象，尽管如果你试图采取危险或破坏性的行为或思维方式，想法可能会作为一种警告形式进入你的心灵。</p><p>Fear that is born of negative imagination comprises the vast majority of the fear with which you entertain yourself. This you must learn to counteract, for it is an inappropriate use of your mind. Here you create an experience for yourself, experience it and then call it reality. Meanwhile, you have not been present with life at all. You have merely been in fantasy within yourself. Negative imagination drains you emotionally, physically and mentally. It can be escalated to such heights that it can dominate your thinking altogether. For how else can you be separate in the universe except in your own thoughts? You cannot actually be separate from God. You cannot actually be separate from Knowledge. You can only hide in your own thoughts and weave them together to create a separate identity and experience for yourself which, though quite demonstrative, are in fact completely an illusion.</p><p>由消极想象产生的恐惧占你自娱自乐的恐惧的绝大部分。你必须学会抵制这种恐惧，因为这是对心灵的不当使用。在这里，你为自己创造一种经历，体验它，然后称之为现实。与此同时，你根本没有与生命同在。你只是沉浸在自己的幻想中。消极的想象会消耗你的情感、身体和心理。它可以升级到如此高度，以至于完全主宰你的思维方式。因为除了在你自己的感想中，你还能在宇宙中分离吗？你实际上无法与上帝分离。你实际上无法与内识分离。你只能隐藏在你自己的感想中，并将它们编织在一起，为自己创造一种独立的身份和体验，虽然这很有说服力，但实际上完全是一种幻觉。</p><p>In your two meditation practices today, once again enter into stillness. Today there will be no mental speculation or activity, for the mind will once again come to rest so that it may experience its reality. Let not fear or anxiety dissuade you. Remember, this is your negative imagination only. Only Knowledge can indicate if you are doing something inappropriate, and that will only be in the face of immediate events. You will find that this is quite different from negative imagination and will require a different response from you.</p><p>在今天的两次冥想练习中，请再次进入静止状态。今天将不会有任何心理猜测或活动，因为心灵将再次得到休息，从而体验到它自己的真实。不要因为恐惧或焦虑而放弃。记住，这只是你的消极想象。只有内识才能指出你是否做了不恰当的事情，而这只会在面对眼前的事件时才会出现。你会发现这与消极想象截然不同，需要你做出不同的反应。</p><p>Practice 128: Two 30-minute practice periods.</p><p>练习 128： 两个 30 分钟的练习时段</p>]]></content>

Do not try to get even with God by making the world destitute, for God created a world of beauty and opportunity. Do not try to get even with God by refusing to love or accept yourself, for God still knows you as you are. Do not try to get even with God today by ruining your relationships for your own selfish purposes, for God understands your relationships as they truly exist and understands their greater promise as well. You cannot get even with God. You can only harm yourself.</p><p>不要试图通过做一个悲惨的人来报复上帝，因为上帝只知道你是创造的一部分。不要试图通过让世界变得一无所有来报复上帝，因为上帝创造了一个充满美丽和机遇的世界。不要试图通过拒绝爱自己或不接受自己来报复上帝，因为上帝仍然知道你的本来样子。今天，不要为了一己私欲而破坏关系，以此来报复上帝，因为上帝理解你的关系的真实存在，也理解它们更大的承诺。你无法报复上帝。你只能伤害自己。</p><p>Therefore, accept that you have lost the battle against God. In your defeat is your greatest victory, for God has never lost you, though you have lost God temporarily in your imagination. Your love for God is so profound that you are as yet afraid of it, for it represents the greatest power within you that you can possibly possess. You must learn of this through direct experience. Therefore, do not try to get even with God today by reinforcing an idea about yourself based solely upon error and assumption, for Knowledge is with you. You are the happy victor in your own defeat.</p><p>因此，接受你在与上帝的战斗中失败的事实吧。你的失败是你最大的胜利，因为上帝从未失去你，尽管你在想象中暂时失去了上帝。你对上帝的爱是如此深沉，以至于你至今都害怕上帝，因为它代表着你内心可能拥有的最大力量。你必须通过直接体验来知道这一点。因此，今天不要试图通过强化对自己的想法来报复上帝，因为内识与你同在。你是自己失败后的胜利者。</p><p>In your two practice periods today, repeat this idea and then attempt to think about it. Our practices today will be engaging the mind in exploration and analysis. This is a useful application of your mind. Think about this message and all of your ideas surrounding it, and you will begin to understand your own current belief system. You will be able to understand this objectively. Then you will be able to work with it, for the mind is fixed in a certain structure until it is utilized for other purposes. Do not accept this structure as your reality, for the outward manifestation of your mind is a structure that you have imposed upon it. Yet its real inward harmony and nature seek only to be expressed. To enable this to happen you must have an adequate structure in the mind to enable the mind to express itself in the physical world without restraint or distortion. It is towards this, then, that We will work today.</p><p>在今天的两次练习中，请重复这个想法，然后尝试思考。我们今天的练习将让心灵参与探索和分析。这是对心灵的有益运用。思考这个讯息以及围绕它的所有想法，你就会开始理解自己当前的信仰体系。你将能够客观地理解这一点。然后，你就能善用它，因为心灵在被用于其他目的之前，是固定在某种结构中的。不要把这种结构当作你的现实，因为你心灵的外在表现是你强加给它的结构。然而，它真正的内在和谐和自然只寻求表达。要做到这一点，你必须在心灵中建立适当的结构，使心灵能够在物理世界中不受束缚、不受扭曲地表达它自己。因此，我们今天要努力实现这一点。</p><p>Practice 127: Two 30-minute practice periods. </p><p>练习 127 ：两个 30 分钟的练习时段</p>]]></content>

This will allow Knowledge to shine through you, for you will not be attempting to make the world into what you wish it to be, and you will not be attempting to make yourself into what you wish yourself to be. This is the beginning of true resolution and true happiness, but even greater than this, it is the beginning of genuine contribution.</p><p>如果你能学会客观地对待自己，你就能学会客观地对待世界。这将让内识在你身上大放异彩，因为你不会试图把世界变成你希望的样子，也不会试图把自己变成你希望的样子。这是真实的决心和真实幸福的开始，但比这更重要的是，这是真正贡献的开始。</p><p>In your one long practice period today review the past week, keeping these things in mind.

This takes encouragement because you must risk giving up your selfhatred, which is a way that you separate yourself from life.</p><p>你已经是某个人，为什么还要试图成为另一个人呢？成为你已经是的这个人更好。你已经是的这个人，是以个人的自然性为载体的内识力量。这一点已经确立，现在正在发展之中。为什么今天还要尝试成为某个人呢？为什么不成为你本来的样子呢？找出你是谁。这需要极大的勇气，因为你必须冒着失望于自己理想化的自我形象以及你所希望世界的风险。这需要鼓励，因为你必须冒着放弃自我厌恶的风险，而自我厌恶是你与生命分离的一种方式。</p><p>Therefore, this day be exactly as you are. Remind yourself upon the hour. And in your two meditation practices today, allow yourself to be still and to receive, for you are not trying to be someone today.</p><p>因此，今天就要像你本来的样子一样。每小时提醒自己一次。在你今天的两次冥想实践中，让自己静下来接收自己，因为你今天不需要试图成为某人。</p><p>Practice 125: Two 30-minute practice periods.

Today be yourself, but be self-observant, keeping in mind that Knowledge is with you as you vacillate to and from, towards and away from Knowledge itself. Because Knowledge does not vacillate, it is a source of certainty, consistency and stability for you. Because it is unafraid of the world, it is a source of fearlessness for you. You are not pitiful, so you need not pretend.</p><p>你不需要假装自己很快乐，因为这只会掩盖你的自怜，加剧你的困惑，加深你的困境。今天，你要做你自己，但要自我观察，牢记当你摇摆不定地走向或远离内识时，内识与你同在。因为内识不会摇摆不定，所以它是你确定性、一致性和稳定性的来源。因为它不惧怕世界，所以它是你无畏的来源。你并不可怜，所以无需伪装。</p><p>Do not pretend to be happy today, for he or she who is truly satisfied may cast any expression upon the world, but within their expression will be the power of Knowledge. This is what is most important. Knowledge is not a form of behavior. It is an intense experience of life. Therefore, do not attempt to persuade yourself or others with a demonstration of behavior, for this is unnecessary.</p><p>今天，不要假装快乐，因为真实满足的人可以向世界投射任何表情，但在他们的表情中将蕴含着内识的力量。这才是最重要的。内识不是一种行为方式。它是一种强烈的生命体验。因此，不要试图用行为表现来说服自己或他人，因为这是没有必要的。</p><p>Repeat this statement upon the hour and feel its power and its gift of freedom. Allow yourself to be exactly as you are today. In your two deep meditation practices, allow yourself to enter stillness, for when you are not trying to be someone, you may have the luxury of stillness, which is the luxury of love.</p><p>每时每刻重复这句话，感受它的力量和自由的礼物。允许自己做今天的自己。在你的两次深度冥想练习中，允许自己进入静止状态，因为当你不试图成为某个人时，你可以奢侈地享受静止，这是爱的奢侈。</p><p>Practice 124: Two 30-minute practice periods.

Pity must only reassert an old idea of yourself, which is bereft of truth, bereft of hope and bereft of any meaningful foundation. Do not pity yourself today, for you are not pitiful. If this day is sad or confused, it is only because you have lost contact with Knowledge, which you may practice today to regain.</p><p>当内识与你同在时，你怎么能可怜自己呢？自怜只能让你重新认识自己的旧观念，而这种观念是没有真理、没有希望、没有任何意义的。今天，不要可怜自己，因为你并不可怜。如果你今天感到悲伤或困惑，那只是因为你失去了与内识的连接，而你今天可以通过练习来重新获得内识。</p><p>As you practice today, be aware of the many subtle forms of self-pity that you entertain. Be aware of the many subtle forms of manipulation of others as you attempt to make them like or accept you according to a view of yourself that you are attempting to claim. When you are with Knowledge, you do not need to proclaim yourself; you do not need to show yourself; you do not need to control others to like or accept you, for Knowledge is with you.</p><p>在今天的练习过程中，要注意自己许多微妙的自怜形式。注意你操纵他人的许多微妙形式，因为你试图按照自己的观点让他人喜欢或接受你。当你与内识同在时，你不需要宣扬自己；你不需要展示自己；你不需要控制他人来喜欢或接受你，因为内识与你同在。</p><p>Therefore, do not pity yourself, for you are not pitiful. Today be a beginning student of Knowledge, for that is anything but pitiful. A greater vantage point you cannot imagine.</p><p>因此，不要可怜自己，因为你并不可怜。今天，做一名内识的初学者吧，因为这并不可怜。你无法想象更高的境界。</p><p>Upon the hour, then, repeat this idea. Allow it to enter your mind and consider it for a moment. In your two practice periods, repeat this affirmation and then enter into stillness. No being who is pitiful can enter into silence, for silence is the experience of profound relationship, and stillness is the acceptance of profound love. Who can be pitiful under such circumstances?</p><p>因此，在这个时刻，重复这个想法。让它进入你的心灵，并思考片刻。在你的两次练习中，重复这句话，然后进入静止状态。没有一个可怜的人可以进入静止，因为静止是对深刻关系的体验，静止是对深刻爱的接纳。在这种情况下，谁还会可怜呢？</p><p>Practice 123: Two 30-minute practice periods.

It is not a physical thing that you give, though physical things can be given for good. It is not something that you can quantify, for you have no idea of its extent. You are giving strength and encouragement.</p><p>要求你给予的内识只会随着你的给予而增加。你给予的不是实物，尽管实物也能带来益处。它不是你可以量化的实物，因为你不知道它的程度。你给予的是力量和鼓励。</p><p>Today in your two practice periods, continue your giving to others. This is an active form of prayer. Think not that the power of it is not received by those whom you have concentrated upon. Remember today not to try to determine the outcome of their dilemma or their need, but only encourage and empower them to carry forth with their own abilities. You wish to stimulate Knowledge within them as Knowledge is now being stimulated within you. This giving, then, will not have an expectation of a return, for you are giving that which enables others to be strong in their lives. You are not in a position to judge the outcome, for the outcome of your giving will not be revealed until later when the gift has been accepted and has found its place in the receiver. Therefore, give freely without expectation and give in order to experience the power of your gift this day.</p><p>今天，在你的两次练习中，请继续给予他人。这是一种积极的祷告形式。不要以为你所专注的人没有收到你的力量。记住，今天不要试图决定他们困境的结果或他们的需要，而只是鼓励他们，赋予他们力量，让他们用自己的能力去实现。你希望激发他们内心的内识，就像现在你内心的内识一样。因此，这种给予并不期待回报，因为你的给予能让他人在生命中变得强大。你没有资格评判结果，因为你给予的结果要等到礼物被接受并在接收者身上找到位置之后才会显现。因此，自由给予，不抱期望，给予是为了在这一天体验你的礼物的力量。</p><p>Practice 122: Two 30-minute practice periods.</p><p>练习 122 ：两个 30 分钟的练习时段</p>]]></content>

Send that individual that quality. Send them love or strength or faith or encouragement or determination or surrender or acceptance or self-discipline—whatever they need to bring about resolution in their lives. You are free to give this today, for your own needs are being met.</p><p>今天你将有两次特别的练习，你要想到一个需要帮助的人，然后给他一种你自己也希望得到的品质。把这种品质送给这个人。向他传递爱、力量、信念、鼓励、决心、屈服、接纳或自律——任何他需要的品质，以解决他生命中的问题。今天，你可以自由地传递这些，因为你自己的需求正在得到满足。</p><p>Therefore, in each of your two practices, with your eyes closed, bring to mind individuals and give to them what you know they need. Do not try to solve their problems for them. Do not try to strengthen a preferred outcome, for you cannot usually know the right outcome for any other person. But you can always give strength of character and strengthen their faculties of mind. This will give you your own sense of purpose and will reassert these qualities within yourself, for you must possess them to give them, and in giving them you realize that they are in your possession already.</p><p>因此，在你的两次练习中，闭上眼睛，想起一些人，并给予他们你知道他们需要的品质。不要试图替他们解决问题。不要试图强化他们所希望的结果，因为你通常无法知道其他人的正确结果。但你总能给予他们性格的力量，增强他们的心灵。这将给你自己带来目标感，并在你的内心深处重申这些品质，因为你必须拥有它们才能给予它们，而在给予它们的过程中，你会认识到它们已经在你的心中。</p><p>As you practice today, have no doubt that what you exert for others will be received by them on their own behalf.</p><p>在今天的练习中，你要坚信，你为他人付出的一切，他们也会以自己的名义接收它。</p><p>Practice 121: Two 30-minute practice periods.</p><p>练习 121 ：两个 30 分钟的练习时段</p>]]></content>

Remember that it abides with you regardless of where you go or what you are doing. Remember that it is given to you to serve you, to nurture you and to elevate you as well. Remember that you need not be aggravated with the world because you can accept the world as it is. Remember that you accept the world as it is so that you will be able to give to it, for the world is developing as you are.

Try to remember how seriously you thought about each day’s practice and how well you utilized that practice. Do not think you can complain rightfully about this preparation unless you are utilizing it to its fullest extent. Your role here is only to follow the steps as they are given and not to alter them according to your preferences. In this way, you place yourself in a position to receive, which is the position you now need to acquire for yourself.</p><p>在这次特别复习中，请回顾过去两周的练习，复习每一条指令，回忆每一天的练习。试着回忆一下你是如何认真思考每一天的练习的，以及你是如何很好地善用这些练习的。除非你充分善用了这些准备，否则不要认为你可以理直气壮地抱怨这些准备。在这里，你的任务只是按照规定的步骤去做，而不是根据自己的喜好去改变。这样，你就能使自己处于接收的位置，这也是你现在需要为自己获得的位置。</p><p>In your two long practice periods today, each one given to one week of practice, review the past two weeks. Try to be very kind with yourself, but recognize if you are falling short of the requirements and do not deceive yourself in this regard. Rededicate yourself to deepening your practice and your resolve, reminding yourself of the simplicity of your life and the true value that is being given to you. In this way, you will learn a new way of living. You will learn how to receive and how to give, and your life will be free of the darkness of complexity. For simplicity must always be of the light; it must always be of the good.</p><p>在今天的两次长时间练习中，每次练习一周，回顾过去两周。试着对自己好一点，但要认识到自己是否达不到要求，不要在这方面欺骗自己。重新致力于深化你的练习和决心，提醒自己生命的简单性和赋予你的真正价值。这样，你将学会一种新的生活方式。你将学会如何接收，如何给予，你的生活将摆脱复杂的黑暗。因为简单必须永远是光明的，必须永远是美好的。</p><p>Therefore, give yourself to this Review so that you may understand how you learn.

When you are with Knowledge, you are here to serve the world. The world, then, is not a prison anymore. It is not a continual source of discomfort and disappointment. It provides for you an opportunity to give and an opportunity to re-establish your true understanding. Do not seek refuge in spiritual things, for your purpose is to give to the world. Allow the world to be as it is, and your condemnation of it will not come back to haunt you. For without condemnation, there is only the opportunity to give. This will draw upon your Knowledge, which will give of its own, and you will be the vehicle for its giving.</p><p>当你与内识同在时，就无需回避世界，因为世界无法主宰你。当你与内识同在时，你在这里是为了服务世界。那么，世界不再是一个监狱。它不再是一个持续带来不适和失望的来源。它为你提供了一个给予的机会，一个重新建立真正理解的机会。不要寻求在精神关系中寻求庇护，因为你的目的是为了给予世界。容许世界保持它的本来面貌，你对它的谴责也不会回过头来困扰你。因为没有谴责，只有给予的机会。这将调动你的内识，它将自行给予，而你将成为它给予的载体。</p><p>Think of this now. Allow yourself in your two practice periods to experience the presence of Knowledge in your life. Demand nothing of it. Seek not to question it. Only allow yourself to experience it, for with this all that you seek returns to you naturally without your effort. Utilize your self-discipline only to direct your mind in the proper direction. Once it is so engaged, it will return to Knowledge of its own accord. For that is its destination, that is its love, that is its true companion and that is its true marriage in life.</p><p>现在想一想这一点。在你的两次练习期间，允许你自己体验生命中内识的存在。不要对它有所要求。不要试图质疑它。只是允许自己去经历，因为有了这个，所有你寻求的自然将回到你的身边，无需你的努力。运用你的自我约束力来引导你的心灵朝正确的方向发展。一旦如此，它将自行回归到内识之中。因为这是它的归宿，这是它的爱，这是它真实的伴侣，也是它在生命中的真实结合。</p><p>Practice 118: Two 30-minute practice periods.</p><p>练习 118 ：两个 30 分钟的练习时段</p>]]></content>

Complexity is a state of self-disassociation which renders you incapable of enjoying life and perceiving your role within it. This is the source of all great poverty, for no worldly accomplishment and no worldly possession can banish the sense of isolation and destitution that accompanies such a disassociation.</p><p>简单使你能够进入生命并在每一刻享受其恩惠。复杂是一种自我分离的状态，使你无法享受生活并意识到自己在其中的角色。这是所有极度贫穷的根源，因为没有世俗的成就和财富可以驱散伴随这种分离的孤立感和贫困感。</p><p>Therefore, today practice stillness more deeply than before so that you may experience the power of Knowledge that is with you. Allow yourself to be simple, for in simplicity all things may be given to you. If you are considering yourself to be complex, or your problems to be complex, it is because you are viewing yourself and your problems without Knowledge and are thus lost in your evaluations. Here you are confusing things of greater value with things of lesser value, things of greater priority with things of lesser priority. Truth must always bring simplicity, for simplicity brings resolution and right understanding and establishes peace and confidence in those who can receive it.</p><p>因此，今天更深入地练习静止，以便你可以经历与你同在的内识的力量。让自己保持简单，因为在简单中一切都可以赋予你。如果你认为自己很复杂，或者你的问题很复杂，那是因为你在没有内识的情况下看待自己和你的问题，因此在评估中迷失了方向。在这里，你混淆了更有价值的关系与较低价值的关系，更重要的关系与次要的关系。真理必须总是带来简单，因为简单带来解决和正确的理解，并能够在接收它的人心中建立和平与信心。</p><p>Practice deeply today. Repeat today’s idea upon the hour, and in your two deep meditation practices, remind yourself that Knowledge is with you and then enter into stillness. Allow yourself to be simple and trust that Knowledge will guide you in all ways.</p><p>今天深入练习。每小时重复今天的想法，在你的两次深度冥想练习中，提醒自己内识与你同在，然后进入静止。让自己保持简单，并相信内识会在所有方面指导你。</p><p>Practice 117: Two 30-minute practice periods.

Knowledge is far more still than you are. It is far more powerful than you are. It is far more certain than you are, and all of its actions are profound and meaningful. There is only a contrast between you and Knowledge because you live in the self that you have made for yourself, and you have temporarily lost your contact with Knowledge. But Knowledge abides with you, for you can never leave it. It will always be there to redeem you, to save you and to reclaim you unto itself, for it is your True Self. Let not beliefs and assumptions masquerade as Knowledge. Allow your mind to become increasingly quiet and still as you undertake the activities of the day.</p><p>要有耐心，这样你才能追随内识。内识比你更加静止。它比你更加强大。它比你更加确定，它的一切行动都是深远而有意义的。你与内识之间的唯一对比是因为你生活在你自己创造的自我之中，你暂时失去了与内识的联系。但内识与你同在，因为你永远无法离开它。它将永远在这里赎回你，拯救你，并重新将你拥入其中，因为它是你真实的自我。不要让信念和假设伪装成内识。让你的心灵在一天的活动中变得越来越宁静和静止。</p><p>Repeat the idea upon the hour and in your two deep meditation practices, allow yourself to enter the stillness and the certainty that Knowledge possesses for you.

It requires your attention. It requires your desire. It requires the relinquishment of things which preoccupy and concern you, things you cannot resolve on your own. Listen to Knowledge today so that it may comfort you and abide with you. In its silence, you will find solid reassurance and confidence as well. For if Knowledge is silent, you need not have anxiety about your life, and if Knowledge speaks, you need only follow so that you may learn the power of Knowledge for you.</p><p>今天倾听内识的力量。它需要你的关注。它需要你的渴望。它需要你放下那些牵扯和担忧你的事物，那些你无法独自解决的工作。今天倾听内识，让它安慰你，并与你同在。在它的沉默中，你将找到坚实的安慰和信心。因为如果内识沉默，你无需为生活感到焦虑；如果内识开口，你只需跟随它，以便你可以学习内识对你的力量。</p><p>You become still because Knowledge is still. You become capable of action because Knowledge is capable of action. You learn to speak with simplicity because Knowledge speaks with simplicity. You learn to be at ease because Knowledge is at ease. You learn to give because Knowledge gives. It is to re-engage you in relationship with your Knowledge that you are now engaged in this program of development.</p><p>你变得安静是因为内识是安静的。你能够行动是因为内识能够行动。你学会简单言语是因为内识言语简单。你学会放松是因为内识是放松的。你学会给予是因为内识的给予。你现在参与这个发展计划，是为了重新与你的内识建立关系。</p><p>Upon the hour today, remind yourself to listen to Knowledge and take a moment to do so in whatever circumstance you find yourself. Your first activity in listening is stillness. Practice this in greater depth in your two meditation practices today, where you practice stillness and receptivity because you wish to listen to Knowledge today.</p><p>在今天的每个整点，提醒自己倾听内识，并在你所处的任何情境中花一点时间这样做。倾听的第一步是安静。今天在你的两次冥想实践中深入练习这一点，你将练习安静和接受，因为你希望今天倾听内识。</p><p>Practice 115: Two 30-minute practice periods.

I AM NOT ALONE."></a>STEP 114  MY TRUE FRIENDS ARE WITH ME. I AM NOT ALONE.</h2><p>How can you be alone when your Teachers are with you? What truer friend do you have than he or she who abides with your Knowledge? These friendships are not born of this world. They have been created beyond the world, and they exist to serve you now. You will feel the presence of those who are with you once your mind settles down. Once you cease to be preoccupied with your own fervent wishes and fears, you will begin to feel this presence which is so graceful, so gentle and so reassuring.</p><p>当你的老师与你同在时，你怎能孤独？还有什么比与你的内识同在的人更真实的朋友呢？这些友谊并非诞生于这个世界。他们是在世界之外被创造出来的，他们现在的存在就是为了服务于你。一旦你的心平静下来，你就会感受到那些与你同在的存在。一旦你不再专注于自己的热切愿望和恐惧，你就会开始感受到这种如此优雅、如此温柔、如此令人安心的存在。</p><p>Upon the hour today, remind yourself that your friends are with you. In your two deep practice periods, allow your mind to receive their presence so that you may understand the true nature of relationship in the world. With practice, this understanding will become so strong that you will be able to receive the ideas, the encouragement and the correction from those who are more potent than you, who exist to serve you in your true function in the world. They are your initiators into Knowledge, and they are in relationship with your Knowledge, for your Knowledge contains your true relationships with all of life.</p><p>今天的每一小时，都要提醒自己，你的朋友与你同在。在你的两次深度练习中，让你的心灵接受他们的存在，这样你就能理解世界上关系的真实实质。通过练习，这种理解会变得如此强烈，以至于你能够接受来自那些比你更强大的人的想法、鼓励和纠正，他们的存在是为了服务于你在这个世界上的真实功能。他们是你进入内识的启蒙者，他们与你的内识息息相关，因为你的内识包含了你与所有生命的真实关系。</p><p>Practice 114: Two 30-minute practice periods.

There is nothing very mysterious about this. It is simply the result of one mind being more concentrated or focused than another. Minds have relative degrees of influence upon one another, depending upon their concentration and depending upon the kind of influence they exert. Let Knowledge persuade you, for that is the greatness that you carry. Let not the opinions or will of others persuade you. Let only their Knowledge influence you, for only this can influence your Knowledge. This will be quite different from feeling dominated, manipulated or persuaded by others.</p><p>任何一个比你更坚定的心灵都可以说服你，对你施加影响。这并不神秘。这只是一个心灵比另一个更集中或更专注的结果。心灵在彼此之间具有相对程度的影响力，这取决于它们的集中程度和它们施加的影响种类。让内识说服你，因为这是你的伟大之处。不要让他人的观点或意愿说服你。只让他们的内识影响你，因为只有他们的内识才能影响你的内识。这与被他人支配、操纵或说服的感觉截然不同。</p><p>Therefore, keep to yourself. Follow Knowledge. If another stimulates your Knowledge, then give that individual your attention so that you may learn of the true powers of persuasion. Yet let not the persuasions of this world—its grievances, its cherished ideals, its morality, its demands or its compromises—influence you, for you are following Knowledge, and you need not follow the persuasions of the world.</p><p>因此，保持自己。跟随内识。如果另一个人激发了你的内识，那么给予那个人你的关注，以便你能够学习到真实的说服力量。但不要让这个世界的说服力量——它的不满、它珍视的理想、它的道德、它的要求或它的妥协——影响你，因为你正在跟随内识，你无需追随世界的说服力量。</p><p>Remind yourself of today’s idea upon the hour and practice stillness deeply in your two meditation practices today. Allow only Knowledge to persuade you, for this is all that you need to follow in the world.</p><p>在整点的时候提醒自己今天的这个观念，并且今天在你的两次冥想实践中深度实践静心。只允许内识来说服你，因为这是你在世界上需要跟随的一切。</p><p>Practice 113: Two 30-minute practice periods.

Let not anxieties or the burden of concern take you away from your practice today.</p><p>今天，请放心，因为内识与你同在，你的老师们与你同在，你的精神家庭与你同在。不要让焦虑或担忧的重担使你远离今天的实践。</p><p>As you move through the day, practicing upon the hour, remind yourself to be at ease, for Knowledge is your guide now. If it is untroubled, you need not be troubled. Release yourself from habitual preoccupations, from habitual bondage. Strengthen your resolve to do this and it will become easier in time. Then it will happen all by itself most naturally. Your mind has habits of thought. That is all they are. As they are replaced with new habits, Knowledge will begin to shine through the structure that you have imposed upon it. Here Knowledge will begin to shine forth, to guide your actions, to lead you to insight and important discovery and to give you a greater strength and certainty than you have ever known.</p><p>当你度过一天，每小时进行实践时，提醒自己放松，因为现在内识是你的向导。如果它安宁无恙，你也无需忧虑。释放自己不要被习惯性的全神贯注所困扰，从习惯性的束缚中解脱出来。坚定你做到这一点的决心，随着时间的推移会变得更容易。然后，这些变化将自然而然地发生。你的心灵有感想的习惯，它们只是习惯而已。当它们被新的习惯所取代时，内识将开始透过你所强加的结构闪耀出来。在这里，内识将开始显现，引导你的行动，带领你找到洞察力和重要的发现，并给予你比你以往任何时候都更大的力量和确定性。</p><p>In your hourly practices, therefore, utilize your selfdiscipline on your own behalf. In your two meditation practices, remain very alert but with a still mind.</p><p>因此，在每小时的实践中，为了自己的利益善用你的自律。在你的两次冥想实践中，保持非常警觉但心境平静。</p><p>Practice 111: Two 30-minute practice periods.

This day allow everything to function as it actually does, without attempting to govern or manipulate yourself. The only exception to this is to utilize your self-discipline so that you may carry out your practices for this day.</p><p>试着做你今天所处的位置。简单一点。从容不迫。观察周围的世界。完成你的世俗任务。不要抬高自己。不要贬低自己。这一天，让一切按照实际情况运行，不要试图管理或操纵自己。唯一的例外是善用你的自律性，以便你可以进行这一天的练习。</p><p>In your two longer practice periods, repeat the affirmation for today and enter into stillness.

Do not be in a hurry. You need not be in a hurry because you are with Knowledge. You may keep your appointments in the world and keep them on schedule, but within yourself do not be in a hurry. You may seek Knowledge, fulfillment and contribution, but do not be in a hurry. When you are in a hurry, you are neglecting your current step for steps you find more preferable, and how can steps be more preferable except when you are ignoring the step in front of you? You need only take the step in front of you, and the next step will arise naturally. Do not be in a hurry. You cannot go faster than you can go. Do not miss all that We are giving you to practice, which will require that you not be in a hurry.</p><p>今天每一步都优雅地迈出。不要急于求成。你无需急于求成，因为你与内识同在。你可以按时履行世间的约定，但内心不要急于求成。你可以追求内识、成就和贡献，但不要急于求成。当你急于求成时，你忽略了当前的步伐，而偏好那些你认为更好的步伐，而这些步伐怎么会更好呢，除非你忽略了眼前的步伐？你只需要迈出眼前的步伐，下一步自然会出现。不要急于求成。你不能走得比你能走得更快。不要错过我们为你提供的所有练习，这要求你不要急于求成。</p><p>Throughout the day today remind yourself upon the hour not to be in a hurry. Say to yourself, “I will not be in a hurry today,” and think a moment upon this. You may meet your worldly responsibilities without being in a hurry. You may meet your greater goals without being in a hurry. Take comfort in the fact that you are a beginning student, for beginning students do not know where they are going because they are in a position to receive, not to govern. This is a great blessing for you now and will give you the power in time to govern your mind and your affairs with Knowledge. You will be a kind ruler who will not condemn error and will not punish sinners, as you now imagine God to do.</p><p>今天整天提醒自己不要急于求成。对自己说，“今天我不会急于求成。”然后想一想这一点。你可以在不急于求成的情况下履行世间的责任。你可以在不急于求成的情况下实现更大的目标。安心于自己是一个初学者，因为初学者不知道自己要去哪里，因为他们正处于接收的位置，而不是主导的位置。这对你来说是一个巨大的祝福，并且随着时间的推移，它会赋予你以内识来管理自己的心灵和事务的力量。你将成为一个仁慈的统治者，不会谴责错误，不会像你现在想象的那样惩罚罪人。</p><p>Knowledge is not in a hurry. Why should you be? Knowledge may move you quickly or slowly. You may then move quickly or slowly, but within yourself you are not in a hurry. This is part of the mystery of life which you can now learn to discover.</p><p>内识不急于求成。你为什么要急于求成？内识可能让你快速或缓慢地行动。你可能会快速或缓慢地行动，但内心你并不急于求成。这是你现在可以学习发现的生命奥秘的一部分。</p><p>Practice 109: Hourly practice. </p><p>练习 109 ：每小时练习</p>]]></content>

All things must now be seen anew, for there is looking with Knowledge and there is looking without Knowledge. They yield different results. They encourage different evaluations and different responses. We have said that happiness is not a form of behavior, for it is much deeper than this. Therefore, do not attempt to use this idea to win favor with others or to demonstrate to yourself that you are happier than you actually are. We do not want to put a veneer of behavior upon your current experience. We want to guide you to that experience which is genuine to your nature, which expresses your nature and which contributes your nature to life.</p><p>现在所有关系都必须重新评估。所有关系都必须重新审视，因为有内识的观察和没有内识的观察会产生不同的结果。它们鼓励不同的评估和不同的回应。我们已经说过，幸福不是一种行为形式，因为它比这要深得多。因此，不要试图利用这个理念去博取他人的好感，或者向自己证明你比实际更幸福。我们不希望在你当前的经验上加上一层行为的表象。我们希望引导你到那种真正符合你自然性的体验，能够表达你的自然性并将你的自然性贡献给生命的经历。</p><p>Learn, then, again about happiness. In your two practice periods, engage your mind in investigation. Consider your ideas about happiness and the forms of behavior you think they must represent. Think of all the ways you have attempted to be happier than you are. Think of all the expectations and requirements you have placed upon yourself to be happy and to prove to yourself and to others your worth. As you recognize these things, realize that without this attempt, happiness will arise upon its own, for you are naturally happy. Without restraint, your happiness will arise upon its own, without your imposing it upon your mind and upon your body. Without your imposition, happiness will arise on its own. Think upon this today, but do not be content with simple conclusions, for you are a beginning student of Knowledge and great conclusions come later.</p><p>那么，重新学习幸福。在今天的两个练习期内，让你的心灵进行探索。思考你关于幸福的理念以及你认为它们必须表现的行为形式。想想所有你试图让自己比实际更快乐的方式。想想你为自己设定的所有期望和要求，以证明自己和他人的价值。当你意识到这些行为时，认识到没有这种企图，幸福会自行产生，因为你本质上是幸福的。没有束缚，你的幸福会自行产生，无需你强加在你的心灵和身体之上。没有你的强加，幸福会自行产生。今天思考这一点，但不要满足于简单的结论，因为你是内识的初学者，重大的结论会在以后出现。</p><p>Practice 108: Two 30-minute practice periods.</p><p>练习 108：两个 30 分钟的练习时段</p>]]></content>

Learning to be happy is learning to accept Knowledge  today. Knowledge is happy today. If you are not happy, you are not with Knowledge. Happiness does not always mean having a smile on your face. It is not a behavior. Genuine happiness is a sense of self, a sense of wholeness and satisfaction. If a loss has occurred in your life, a loss of a loved one, you may still be happy, though you may shed tears. It is all right to shed tears, for this does not need to betray a greater happiness within you, for these also may be tears of happiness. Happiness is not a form of behavior. Let Us remind you of this. It is a sense of inner satisfaction. Knowledge will give this to you because it will simplify your life and allow your mind to concentrate on that which it is given to do in reality. This will empower you, simplify you and provide a greater harmony than you could have known before.</p><p>学会快乐就是学会自然。学会快乐就是学会接受今天的内识。内识就是今天的快乐。如果你不快乐，你就没有与内识在一起。快乐并不总是意味着脸上挂着笑容。它不是一种行为。真正的幸福是一种自我感觉，一种完整感和满足感。如果你的生活中发生了损失，失去了所爱的人，虽然你可能会流泪，但你仍然会感到幸福。流泪是正常的，因为这并不需要背叛你内心更大的幸福，因为这也可能是幸福的泪水。幸福不是一种行为。让我们提醒你这一点。它是一种内心的满足感。内识会让你获得这种满足感，因为它能简化你的生活，让你的心灵专注于它在现实中被赋予的使命。这将增强你的能力，简化你的生活，为你带来前所未有的和谐。</p><p>Therefore, in your two practice periods today, allow your mind to enter stillness once again. This is a time of quietude. This is not a practice of mental investigation, but a practice of mental stillness.</p><p>因此，在今天的两次练习中，让你的心灵再次进入静止状态。这是一个安静的时刻。这不是心理探究的练习，而是静心的练习。</p><p>Practice 107: Two 30-minute practice periods. </p><p>练习 107： 两个 30 分钟的练习时段</p>]]></content>

There are advanced students. There are students of great accomplishment. But there are no Masters living in the world. Perfection is not found here, only contribution. Whoever remains in the world remains to learn the lessons of the world. The lessons of the world must be learned not only in your individual life, but in a life of contribution as well. Your genuine education far exceeds what you have realized thus far. It is not merely the correction of errors. It is the contribution of gifts. </p><p>世界上没有大师，因为大师的境界是在超越世界的地方达到的。这里有进阶的学生，有取得伟大成就的学生，但世界上没有大师。这里没有完美，只有贡献。无论谁留在世界上，都还需要学习世界的课程。这些课程不仅要在你个人的生命中学习，还要在贡献的生命中学习。你的真正教育远远超过你迄今为止所意识到的。它不仅仅是错误的纠正，而是礼物的贡献。</p><p>There are no Masters living in the world. Therefore, you may relieve yourself of the great burden of attempting or requiring Mastery for yourself. You yourself cannot be a Master, for life is the Master. That is the great difference that will make all of the difference for you when you come to understand its true meaning and benefit.</p><p>世界上没有大师。因此，你可以解除试图成为大师或要求自己成为大师的巨大负担。你自己无法成为大师，因为生命才是大师。这是一个伟大的差别，当你理解其真正的意义和益处时，它将为你带来一切的不同。</p><p>In your two practice periods today, think of all the individuals that you have considered to be Masters—individuals you have met, heard of or imagined, individuals in the past and individuals living presently. Think of all the qualities that have made them Masters and how you have used them to judge yourself and to evaluate your life and your behavior. It is not the purpose of advanced students to become the criteria for selfcondemnation by those of lesser capabilities. That is not their gift, though they must understand in time that their gifts will be so misconstrued.</p><p>在今天的两个练习期间，思考所有你认为是大师的人——你遇到的、听说过的或想象中的人，过去和现在存在的人。思考使他们成为大师的所有品质，以及你如何用这些品质来评判自己、评估你的生命和行为。高阶学生的目的不是成为能力较低者自我谴责的标准。这不是他们的礼物，尽管他们必须在时间中理解他们的礼物会被如此误解。</p><p>Accept your unburdening as We remind you that there are no Masters living in the world. In your two longer practice periods, try to realize this. Try to realize the relief that is being given to you. But do not make the mistake of thinking that this leads to passivity on your part, for greater than ever will be your involvement in the reclamation of Knowledge. Greater than ever will be your commitment to the emergence of Knowledge. Now your involvement and commitment may move forward more rapidly, for they are becoming unburdened by your idealism, which can only lead you astray.</p><p>接受你的减负，因为我们提醒你，世界上没有大师。在今天的两个较长的练习期间，试着意识到这一点。试着意识到这是给你的解脱。但不要犯错误地认为这会导致你的被动，因为你对内识恢复的参与将比以往任何时候都更大。你对内识出现的承诺也将比以往任何时候都更强。现在，你的参与和承诺可以更快地前进，因为它们正在摆脱你的理想主义的负担，而理想主义只会使你误入歧途。</p><p>Practice 106: Two 30-minute practice periods. </p><p>练习 106 ：两个 30 分钟的练习时段</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="STEP-105-REVIEW"><a href="#STEP-105-REVIEW" class="headerlink" title="STEP 105  REVIEW"></a>STEP 105  REVIEW</h2><p>In your Review, follow the past examples and review the week of instructions and the week of practices. Give special consideration today to the ideas that We have presented. Understand that these ideas must be entertained and experienced through many stages of development. Their meaning is too deep and too great to be entirely obvious to you now, yet they will serve as a reminder that Knowledge is with you and that you have come to give Knowledge in the world.</p><p>在你的回顾中，遵循以往的课程，回顾本周的指示和本周的练习。今天特别关注我们所提出的观点。要明白这些观点必须通过多阶段的发展来体验和理解。它们的意义对于你现在来说可能并不完全明显，但它们将提醒你，内识与你同在，你来到这个世界是为了传递内识。</p><p>Our teaching will thus simplify all things, which will resolve the conflicts that you carry now and which will make conflict in the future unnecessary. For to the extent that you are with Knowledge, conflict does not exist. An unconflicted life is the greatest contribution that can be given into the world, for this is a life that will spark the beginning of Knowledge in all, a spark that can carry itself into the future far beyond your individual life. It is this great spark that you are intended to give into the world, for then your giving will have no end and will serve your current generation and the generations to come.</p><p>我们的教学将简化一切，从而解决你目前所带的冲突，并使未来的冲突变得不必要。因为在你与内识同在的程度上，冲突就不存在。一个没有冲突的生命是对世界最大的贡献，因为这是一个将点燃所有人内识火花的生命，这种火花可以超越你个人的生命传递到未来。你注定要把这种伟大的火花带给世界，因为这样你的付出将没有尽头，并将服务于你当前的一代和未来的世代。</p><p>The blessings that you are now experiencing today in your world are the result of these reverberations which are passed from generation to generation as Knowledge is kept alive in the world. The opportunity for you to have Knowledge is born of the giving of those who have lived before, as your giving will provide the opportunity for freedom for those who will follow. This is your greater purpose in life: to keep Knowledge alive in the world. But first you must learn of Knowledge—learn how to recognize it, learn how to accept it, learn how to discern it from the other impulses in your mind and learn the many stages of development that will be required in following Knowledge towards its great fulfillment. That is why you are a beginning student of Knowledge.</p><p>你今天在世界上所经历的祝福是这些从一代传递到另一代的内识回响的结果。你拥有内识的机会是由于那些在你之前生活过的人们的付出，同样，你的付出也将为那些后续的人们提供自由的机会。这是你生命中的更大目的：保持内识在世界上的活力。但首先你必须学习内识——学习如何识别它，学习如何接受它，学习如何从你心灵中的其他冲动中分辨它，以及学习在追随内识达到其伟大成就的过程中所需的多阶段发展。这就是为什么你是一个内识的初学者。</p><p>In your one long practice, undertake your Review in as much detail as possible. Allow confusion and uncertainty to exist, for this is necessary in this stage of investigation. Be happy, then, for all the things that can be truly recognized and know that Knowledge is with you, so you are free to be uncertain.</p><p>在你一次长时间的练习中，尽可能详细地进行回顾。允许困惑和不确定性存在，因为这是调查阶段所必需的。那么，对于所有可以真正认识到的事物感到高兴，并知道内识与你同在，所以你可以自由地感到不确定。</p><p>Practice 105: One long practice period.</p><p>练习 105：一次长时间的练习</p>]]></content>

That must be obvious if you have considered yourself honestly. And yet consider the implications of this. If God knows more about you than you do, then would not God’s evaluation be something that you would want to learn to investigate? Of course it would. And would not your evaluations of yourself be necessarily in error? In this alone you have sinned, for sin is only error. Error calls for correction, not condemnation. You would condemn yourself and think that God would then follow your example and render to you a greater condemnation. That is why people have made God in their image, and that is why you must unlearn what you have made, so that you may find what you know and so that your creations in this world may be for good and have lasting value.</p><p>上帝确实比你更了解你自己。如果你诚实地审视自己，这一点应该是显而易见的。然而，考虑一下这其中的含义。如果上帝比你更了解你自己，那么上帝的评估不是你想要学习并研究的吗？当然是的。那么你对自己的评估必然是错误的吗？仅在这一点上你就已经犯了罪，因为罪只不过是错误。错误需要纠正，而不是谴责。你会谴责自己，并认为上帝会效仿你的例子，对你进行更大的谴责。这就是为什么人们按照自己的形象创造了上帝，也是为什么你必须去忘掉你所创造的经验，这样你才能找到你所知道的，并让你在这个世界上的创造是有益且有持久价值的。</p><p>God knows more about you than you do. Do not pretend you can create yourself, for you have already been created and that which has been genuinely created is far greater and happier than the life that you have realized thus far. It is your unhappiness that is bringing you to truth, for it is driving you to a genuine resolution. This, of course, is true.</p><p>上帝比你更了解你自己。不要假装你可以创造自己，因为你已经被创造了，而且真正被创造的内识远比你迄今为止所认识到的生命要伟大和幸福。正是你的不幸福把你带到了真理面前，因为它正在驱使你寻找真正的解决方案。这当然是事实。</p><p>On the hour repeat this statement and consider it seriously. As you do so, observe the world around you in order to attempt to learn of the meaning of today’s idea in the world. In your longer practice sessions in stillness, allow your mind to become quiet so that it may learn to enjoy its greatness. Give it this opportunity for freedom, and it will give freedom to you in return.</p><p>每小时重复这一声明并认真思考。在你这样做时，观察周围的世界，以尝试学习今天的理念在世界中的意义。在你较长时间的静修练习中，让你的心灵安静下来，以便它能享受其伟大。给它这个自由的机会，它将回报你自由。</p><p>Practice 104: Two 30-minute practice periods. Hourly practice.</p><p>练习 104：两个 30 分钟的练习时段。每小时练习。</p>]]></content>

In the past you have attempted to be something unreal, and it has failed you. Now you are afraid to be anything for fear that failure will pursue you once again. Thus, greatness appears to be littleness and littleness appears to be greatness, and all things are seen backwards or reversed from their true meaning.</p><p>你受到上帝的荣耀，然而这句话会激起你的不确定感，唤起你的负罪感，混淆你的自豪感，激发你内心深处的各种冲突。过去，你曾试图成为某种虚幻的人，但你失败了。现在，你什么都不敢做了，生怕失败会再次找上你。因此，伟大看似渺小，渺小看似伟大，一切关系都被颠倒或扭曲了其真正的意义。</p><p>You are honored by God whether you can accept this or not. It is true regardless of human evaluation, for only things that are beyond evaluation are true. We are taking you to that which is beyond evaluation, which will be the greatest discovery possible in this life or in any life.</p><p>无论你能否接受，你都是上帝的荣耀。无论人类如何评价，这都是真实的，因为只有在评价之外的关系才是真实的。我们将带你进入那评价之外的世界，这将是你今生或任何生命中最伟大的发现。</p><p>Upon the hour repeat this statement and consider it seriously. In your two practice periods, allow your mind once again to be still and receptive so that you may learn to receive the honor that God has for you. Surely, this honor must be directed towards a part of you that you are barely aware of. It is not your behavior that is honored. It is not your idealism that is honored. It is not your beliefs, your assumptions, your demands or your fears. These may be for good or for ill. These may serve you or betray you. But honor is reserved for something greater, which you are now learning to recognize.</p><p>每小时重复这句话，并认真思考。在你的两次练习中，让你的心灵再次安静下来并接纳，这样你就能学会接收上帝给你的荣誉。当然，这种荣誉一定是针对你几乎没有意识到的一部分的。获得荣誉的不是你的行为。获得荣誉的不是你的理想主义。它不是你的信仰、假设、要求或恐惧。这些可能是好的，也可能是坏的。它们可能为你服务，也可能背叛你。但荣誉是为更伟大的关系保留的，你现在正在学习认识它。</p><p>Practice 103: Two 30-minute practice periods.

Thus, your vehicle for giving is burdened and cluttered, and your energy is largely misappropriated. That is why it is God’s first step to unburden you. Until this happens you will simply attempt to resolve your situation without knowing what to do, without understanding your predicament and without accepting the assistance that you will surely need in time. Therefore, accept your unlearning, for it will unburden you and give you reassurance that a greater life is possible and inevitable for you who have come here to give.</p><p>你的生命充满了你自己的需求和想法，充满了你自己的要求和野心，充满了你自己的恐惧和复杂性。因此，你给予的载体负担重重，杂乱无章，而你的能量在很大程度上被误用。这就是为什么上帝的第一步是让你解除负担。在这种情况发生之前，你将只会试图解决自己的状况，却不知道该怎么做，不理解自己的困境，也不接受你将来必然需要的帮助。因此，接受你的忘却学习，因为它将为你解除负担，并向你保证，一个更伟大的生命对你是可能且不可避免的，因为你来到这里是为了给予。</p><p>Upon the hour repeat this statement and consider it. View its reality in terms of your perception of the world. In your two longer practice periods, once again practice mental stillness in silence, where nothing is attempted and where nothing is avoided. You are only engaging your mind to be still so that it may learn to respond upon its own to that which calls to it. With each step you make in your unlearning, Knowledge will fill in that which had replaced it. This is instantaneous, for you are only moving yourself into a position to receive so that your giving may be generous, genuine and fulfilling to you.</p><p>每小时重复这句话并思考它。根据你对世界的看法来审视它的现实。在两次较长的练习时间里，再次练习在沉默中保持心灵的平静，不尝试任何事，也不回避任何事。你只是让你的心灵保持平静，这样它才能自然而然地对其呼唤作出回应。随着你每一步的忘却，内识将填补它所取代的遗忘。这是瞬间完成的，因为你只是在让自己处于一个接收的位置，这样你的给予才能慷慨、真实，并使你充实。</p><p>Practice 102: Two 30-minute practice periods.

Does this not seem inconsistent with the teaching that We are presenting? It is actually not inconsistent at all if you understand its meaning. Since the world needs you, waiting would seem to be an injustice and an irresponsibility. Is this not inconsistent with what We are teaching? No, it is not inconsistent if you understand its meaning. If you have seriously considered what We have given you thus far in your preparation, you will realize that on its own, Knowledge within you will respond to the world, and you will feel moved to give in certain places and not moved to give in others. This great response within you will not be born of personal weakness, personal insecurity or the need for acceptance or recognition. It will not be a form of avoidance or guilt. In fact, it will have nothing to do with you at all. That is why it is very great, for it is not meant to remedy your littleness, but to demonstrate the power of Knowledge that exists in the world so that you may bear witness to it and be a vehicle for its expression.</p><p>当世界需要你时，为什么要等待呢？这看起来似乎与我们所传授的教导不一致。如果你理解其含义，实际上并不矛盾。因为世界需要你，等待似乎是不公正和不负责任的。这与我们所教导的矛盾吗？不，如果你理解其含义，就不会矛盾。如果你认真考虑到目前为止我们给你的准备，你会意识到，你内在的内识会自动对世界做出回应，你会感到被推动在某些地方给予，而在其他地方却没有这种冲动。这种内在的伟大回应不会源于个人的弱点、个人的不安全感或对接受和认可的需求。它不会是一种逃避或内疚的形式。实际上，它与你无关。这就是为什么它非常伟大，因为它不是为了补救你的渺小，而是为了展示世界上存在的内识的力量，以便你能见证它并成为其表达的载体。</p><p>Why wait when the world needs you? Because you are not yet ready to give. Why wait when the world needs you? Because you do not understand its need yet. Why wait when the world needs you? Because you will give for the wrong reasons and will only fortify your dilemma. The time of giving will come, and your life will give of itself, and you will be prepared to accept this, to respond to it and to follow the guidance of Knowledge that is within you. If you are to be of true service to the world, you must be prepared, and that is what We are undertaking now. </p><p>当世界需要你时，为什么要等待？因为你还没有准备好给予。当世界需要你时，为什么要等待？因为你还不了解它的需求。当世界需要你时，为什么要等待？因为你会因为错误的理由而给予，这只会加剧你的困境。给予的时机将会到来，你的生命将自然而然地给予，而你将准备好接受它，对它做出回应并遵循你内在内识的指导。如果你要真实服务于世界，你必须做好准备，这正是我们现在正在进行的工作。</p><p>Let not the tribulations of the world give you great anxiety. Let not the threats of destruction arouse your fear. Let not the injustices of this world stimulate your anger, for if they do, you are looking without Knowledge. You are seeing your own failed idealism. This is not the way of seeing, and so it is not the way of giving. You were sent to give, and your giving is intrinsic to you. You do not need to control it, for it will give of itself when you are prepared. Therefore, your service to the world at this moment is your preparation to be a contributor, and though this will not give you instant gratification for your need to give, it will pave the way for a greater service to be rendered.</p><p>不要让世界的苦难引发你的巨大焦虑。不要让毁灭的威胁引发你的恐惧。不要让这个世界的不公引发你的愤怒，因为如果你这样做了，你就是在没有内识的情况下看待问题。你看到了你自己失败的理想主义。这不是一种正确的看法，所以这也不是一种正确的给予方式。你被派来给予，而你的给予将是内在的。你不需要控制它，因为当你准备好时，它会自然而然地给予。因此，你此刻对世界的服务就是为成为贡献者而做准备，尽管这不会立即满足你给予的需求，但它将为更大的服务铺平道路。</p><p>In your two practice periods today, actively think about today’s idea and consider it in light of your behavior, your inclinations, your ideas and your beliefs.</p><p>今天在两次练习期间，积极思考今天的想法，并结合你的行为、倾向、想法和信念来考虑它。</p><p>Practice 101: Two 30-minute practice periods. </p><p>练习 101：两个 30 分钟的练习时段</p>]]></content>

Accept this starting place. Do not claim more for yourself,  for you do not understand the road to Knowledge. On the road to greater assumptions you may have garnered great rewards for yourself, but that leads in another direction from the road to Knowledge, where all things that are unreal are relinquished and all things that are genuine are embraced. The road to Knowledge is not a road that people have imagined for themselves, for it is not born of imagination.</p><p>你是内识的初学者。接受这个起点。不要为自己宣称更多，因为你不理解通往内识的道路。在追求更大成就的道路上，你可能已经为自己赢得了很多奖赏，但那条道路与通往内识的道路不同。在通往内识的道路上，一切不真实的关系都会被放弃，一切真实的关系都会被拥抱。通往内识的道路不是人们为自己想象的道路，因为它不是由想象而生的。</p><p>Therefore, be a beginning student of Knowledge. Upon the hour repeat this statement and give it serious consideration. Regardless of your view of yourself, whether it is exalted or diminished, no matter what you have done before, no matter what you consider your accomplishments to be, you are a beginning student of Knowledge. As a beginning student you will want to learn everything that can be learned, and you will not have the burden of defending that which you think you have claimed already. This will ease your burden in life considerably and give you the possibility for true motivation and enthusiasm, which are lacking now.</p><p>因此，成为内识的初学者。在每个小时重复这句话，并认真思考它。无论你对自己的看法如何，无论是崇高还是卑微，无论你之前做了什么，无论你认为自己的成就是什么，你都是内识的初学者。作为一名初学者，你会想要学习一切可以学习的关系，你不会有负担去捍卫你认为自己已经拥有的关系。这会极大地减轻你生命中的负担，并给你带来真实的动机和热情，这是现在所缺乏的。</p><p>Be a beginning student of Knowledge. Begin your two longer practice periods with this affirmation and allow yourself to sit in stillness and to receive. Without petitions, without questions and without expectations or demands, allow your mind to be quiet, for you are a beginning student of Knowledge and do not yet know what to ask for or what to expect.</p><p>成为内识的初学者。以这一肯定开始你的两个较长的练习时段，并允许自己静坐接收。不带任何请求，不带任何问题，不带任何期待或要求，允许你的心灵安静下来，因为你是内识的初学者，还不知道该请求什么或期待什么。</p><p>Practice 100: Two 30-minute practice periods.

As thoughts arise that are judgments, simply dismiss them without considering them, for today you are practicing seeing—seeing without judgment so that you may see what is actually there.</p><p>因此，在练习期间，练习睁着眼睛看，不带判断地看。观察你周围的环境，只看实际存在的世界。不要进行想象，不要让你的思绪游离到过去或未来。只见实际存在的世界。当产生判断的想法时，简单地将其排除，不去考虑它们，因为今天你在练习看——不带判断地看，以便你能看到实际存在的世界。</p><p>Practice 99: Two 30-minute practice periods. Hourly practice.</p><p>练习 99：两个 30 分钟的练习时段。每小时练习一次。</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="STEP-98-REVIEW"><a href="#STEP-98-REVIEW" class="headerlink" title="STEP 98  REVIEW"></a>STEP 98  REVIEW</h2><p>In your Review once again review all of the instructions of the lessons and everything that you have experienced thus far in the past week of practice. Honestly evaluate your engagement with these lessons and recognize what they have yielded for you in terms of understanding. Try to be very fair in your assessment. Remember that you are a student. Do not claim that you have realized more than you have actually experienced.</p><p>在回顾中，再次回顾本课的所有指令以及你在过去一周的练习中迄今为止所经历的一切。诚实地评估你对这些课程的参与情况，并认识到这些课程在理解方面给你带来的收获。在评估时要尽量公平。记住，你是一名学生。不要声称你所领悟的比你实际经历的多。</p><p>The simplicity of this approach may seem obvious, but for many people it is very difficult to achieve, for they are so used to thinking that they have more than they have or less than they have that it is very difficult for them to assess their actual circumstances even though their circumstances are quite obvious.</p><p>这种方法的简单性可能显而易见，但对许多人来说却很难实现，因为他们习惯于认为自己拥有的比实际更多或更少，因此很难评估他们的实际情况，尽管他们的情况非常明显。</p><p>In your one long practice period, then, review your lessons and consider each one in depth, recalling your activity with them on the day that they were given and your understanding of them at this moment. Review each of the six previous steps very carefully and beware of making conclusions that do not represent your true experience. It is better to be uncertain than to have false conclusions.</p><p>因此，在你一次长时间的练习中，复习你的课程并深入思考每一课，回想它们在那天给你的活动以及你此刻对它们的理解。非常仔细地回顾前六步的每一步，并注意不要得出不代表你真实体验的结论。宁愿不确定，也不要得出错误的结论。</p><p>Practice 98: One long practice period.</p><p>练习 98：一次长时间的练习</p>]]></content>

      <title>第九十七阶：我不知道什么是满足感</title>
      <link href="/2024/06/29/97/"/>
      <url>/2024/06/29/97/</url>
      
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="STEP-97-I-DO-NOT-KNOW-WHAT-FULFILLMENT-IS"><a href="#STEP-97-I-DO-NOT-KNOW-WHAT-FULFILLMENT-IS" class="headerlink" title="STEP 97  I DO NOT KNOW WHAT FULFILLMENT IS."></a>STEP 97  I DO NOT KNOW WHAT FULFILLMENT IS.</h2><p>Is this statement an admission of weakness? Is it a resignation to hopelessness? No, it is not. It is the beginning of true honesty. When you realize how little you understand and yet realize at the same time the great offer of Knowledge that is available to you, only then will you seize upon this opportunity with great encouragement and dedication. You can only imagine fulfillment, but within you the Knowledge of fulfillment lives and burns. This is a fire that you cannot put out. This is a fire that exists within you now. This represents your greater yearning for fulfillment, for union and for contribution. Far beneath all of your hopes and fears, beneath your plans and ambitions, this fire is burning now. Relinquish, then, your ideas concerning fulfillment, but do not be hopeless, for you are placing yourself in a position to receive the gifts that are intended for you. You have brought these gifts with you into the world. They are hidden within you where you cannot find them.</p><p>这句话是在承认自己的软弱吗？是自认无望吗？不，不是。它是真正诚实的开始。当你意识到自己所知甚少，但同时又意识到内识为你提供的巨大机遇时，你才会以极大的鼓励和奉献精神抓住这个机会。你只能想象实现，但在你的内心深处，实现的内识却存在并燃烧着。这是一团你无法扑灭的火焰。这是一团现在就存在于你体内的火焰。这代表着你对实现、结合和贡献的更大渴望。在你所有的希望和恐惧之下，在你的计划和野心之下，这把火正在燃烧。那么，放弃你关于实现的想法吧，但不要绝望，因为你正在将自己置于收到礼物的位置上。你把这些礼物带到了这个世界。它们藏在你的身体里，在你找不到的地方。</p><p>You do not know what fulfillment is. Happy stimulation alone cannot be fulfillment, for fulfillment is a state of quietude. It is a state of inner acceptance. It is a state of total integration. It is a timeless state expressing itself in time. How can even the happiest stimulation give you that which can abide in any circumstance and which does not cease when the stimulation is over? We do not wish to deprive you of happy stimulations, for they can be very good, but they are momentary and can only give you a glimpse of the greater possibility. Here We wish to take you directly to the greater possibility by cultivating the great resources within your mind and by teaching you a way of seeing the world so that you may learn of its true purpose.</p><p>你不知道什么是满足。仅有快乐的刺激不能算是满足，因为满足是一种安静的状态。它是一种内心接纳的状态。它是一种完全融合的状态。它是一种在时间中表达自己的永恒状态。即使是最快乐的刺激，又怎么能给你一种在任何情况下都能保持，并且在刺激结束时也不会停止的状态呢？我们并不想剥夺你快乐的刺激，因为它们可能非常好，但它们只是瞬间的，只能让你瞥见更大的可能性。在这里，我们希望通过开发你心灵中的巨大资源，教给你一种看待世界的方式，让你了解世界的真正目的，从而直接带你走向更大的可能性。</p><p>Therefore, upon the hour today, repeat today’s idea and consider it seriously in view of yourself and the world around you. Today, in your two long practice periods, once again spend time seriously considering this idea. Remember to think of your own life in these practice periods and apply today’s idea to the plans that you are aware of concerning your own fulfillment. These thinking meditations require mental work. Here you will not be still. You will be investigating. You will be exploring. You will be actively using your mind to penetrate things that you recognize exist there. This is a time for serious introspection. When you realize that what you thought you knew is only a form of imagination, then you will realize your great need for Knowledge.</p><p>因此，今天一到时间，就重复今天的想法，并认真考虑它与你自己以及你周围世界的关系。今天，在你的两次长时间练习中，再次花时间认真思考这个想法。记住，在这些练习时间里，要想想你自己的生活，把今天的想法应用到你所知道的与你自己的成就有关的计划中去。这些思考冥想需要进行心理工作。在这里，你不会一动不动。你将进行调查。你要探索。你将积极地运用你的心灵去洞察你所认识到的关系。这是一个认真反思的时刻。当你意识到你以为你知道的只是想象的一种形式时，你就会意识到你对内识的巨大需求。</p><p>You must understand what you have in order to learn to receive more. If you think you have more than you actually have, then you are impoverished without even being aware of it and will not understand the Great Plan that has been created on your behalf. You must start from where you are, for in this way you may proceed, each step certain, each step forward, built upon the step before. There will be no falling back here, for you will be firmly established on your path to Knowledge.</p><p>你必须理解你所拥有的一切，才能学习收到更多。如果你认为自己拥有的比实际拥有的更多，那么你就会在不知不觉中陷入贫困，也就无法理解为你制定的伟大计划。你必须从现在开始，因为这样你才能继续前进，每一步都是确定的，每一步都是在前一步的基础上向前迈进的。在这里，你不会后退，因为你将在通往内识的道路上站稳脚跟。</p><p>Practice 97: Two 30-minute practice periods. Hourly practice.</p><p>练习 97： 两个 30 分钟的练习时段。每小时练习一次。</p>]]></content>

      <title>第九十六阶：上帝的意志为我卸下重担</title>
      <link href="/2024/06/29/96/"/>
      <url>/2024/06/29/96/</url>
      
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="STEP-96-GOD’S-WILL-IS-FOR-ME-TO-BE-UNBURDENED"><a href="#STEP-96-GOD’S-WILL-IS-FOR-ME-TO-BE-UNBURDENED" class="headerlink" title="STEP 96  GOD’S WILL IS FOR ME TO BE UNBURDENED."></a>STEP 96  GOD’S WILL IS FOR ME TO BE UNBURDENED.</h2><p>God’s first step in your redemption and your empowerment is to unburden you from things that are not necessary for your happiness, to unburden you from things which cannot possibly satisfy you, to unburden you from things which only cause you pain and to lift from your head the crown of thorns that you wear, which represents your attempt at fulfillment in the world. A Greater Will exists within you that wishes to express itself. When you experience this, you will finally feel that you are known to yourself. You will finally experience true happiness, for your life at last will be integrated. You must be unburdened to make this discovery. Nothing of value will be taken from you. It is not God’s intent to make you lonely and forlorn, but to give you the opportunity to realize your true promise so that you may proceed with strength and true motivation.</p><p>上帝在拯救和赋予你力量的第一步是解除你不必要的负担，解除那些无法让你感到幸福的负担，解除那些只会带来痛苦的负担，并从你的头上摘下那象征着你在世间追求满足的荆棘冠冕。在你内心中存在着一个更伟大的意志，它希望表达它自身。当你体验到这一点时，你会终于感受到你是被自己所知道的。你将最终体验到真实的幸福，因为你的生命终于整合在一起。你必须解除负担才能进行这个发现。你不会失去任何有价值的关系。上帝的意志不是让你孤独和绝望，而是给你机会去实现你的真实承诺，以便你可以以力量和真实的动机继续前行。</p><p>Therefore, accept this first great offer to unburden you from the hopeless conflicts that you attempt to resolve, from meaningless pursuits which lead you nowhere, from false promises of this world and from your own idealism which paints a picture the world cannot possibly support. In simplicity and humility the greatness of life will dawn upon you, and you will know that you have given away nothing for something of the greatest value.</p><p>因此，接受这个解除你无望的冲突、无意义的追求、虚假的世界承诺以及你自己无法支持的理想画面的伟大提议。在简单和谦逊中，生命的伟大将会展现在你面前，你会知道你没有为了换取最有价值的内识而失去任何关系。</p><p>Upon the hour repeat this statement and think about it. Observe its meaning in terms of your current circumstances. Observe its demonstration in the lives of people all around you. Observe its reality in terms of your own existence, which you are now learning to witness objectively. </p><p>每小时重复这一声明并思考它。观察它在你当前环境中的意义。观察它在人们生活中的体现。观察它在你自己存在中的现实，你现在正在学习客观地见证这一点。</p><p>In your two longer practice periods today, attempt to concentrate on this idea and apply it to your life specifically. Actively engage your mind and try to think of the meaning of this statement in terms of your current ambitions, your current plans, and so forth. Many things may be cast in doubt as you do this, but realize that Knowledge is not affected by your schemes and plans or by your hopes and disappointments. It is only awaiting the time when it can emerge naturally within you, and you will be the first recipient of its great gifts.</p><p>在今天的两个较长的练习时段中，尝试专注于这个想法并将其具体应用到你的生命中。积极地运用你的心灵，尝试思考这一声明在你的当前抱负、计划等方面的意义。当你这样做时，许多事情可能会被怀疑，但请意识到，内识不会受到你的计划、希望或失望的影响。它只是在等待自然地在你内心中出现的时刻，而你将是其伟大礼物的第一个受益者。</p><p>Practice 96: Two 30-minute practice periods. Hourly practice.</p><p>练习 96：两个 30 分钟的练习时段。每小时练习。</p>]]></content>

      <title>第九十五阶：我怎么可能实现我自己？</title>
      <link href="/2024/06/27/95/"/>
      <url>/2024/06/27/95/</url>
      
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="STEP-95-HOW-CAN-I-POSSIBLY-FULFILL-MYSELF"><a href="#STEP-95-HOW-CAN-I-POSSIBLY-FULFILL-MYSELF" class="headerlink" title="STEP 95  HOW CAN I POSSIBLY FULFILL MYSELF?"></a>STEP 95  HOW CAN I POSSIBLY FULFILL MYSELF?</h2><p>How can you possibly fulfill yourself when you do not know who you are, when you do not know where you have come from or where you are going, when you do not know who has sent you and who will be waiting for you when you return? How can you possibly fulfill yourself alone when you are part of life itself? Can you fulfill yourself apart from life? Only in fantasy and imagination can you possibly even entertain the idea of fulfilling yourself. There is no fulfillment here, only increasing confusion. As the years progress, you will feel a growing darkness within you, as if a great opportunity has been lost. Do not lose this opportunity to realize life as it truly exists and to receive fulfillment as it is truly offered to you.</p><p>当你不知道你是谁，当你不知道你从哪里来，当你不知道你要去哪里，当你不知道是谁派遣了你，谁将在你返回的时候等待你时，你又怎么可能实现你自己呢？当你是生命本身的一部分时，你怎么可能独自实现你自己呢？你能在脱离生命的情况下实现你自己吗？只有在幻想和想象中，你才能甚至考虑实现你自己的想法。在这里没有满足，只有越来越多的困惑。随着岁月的流逝，你会感觉到内心越来越黑暗，仿佛失去了一个伟大的机会。不要失去这个机会，去认识真正存在的生命，去接收真正提供给你的满足。</p><p>Only in imagination can you fulfill yourself otherwise, and imagination is not reality. Accepting this may at first seem like a limitation and a disappointment, for you already have designs and motives for your own personal fulfillment, whether they have been experienced or not. Your entire agenda for your fulfillment must now be brought into question, not to deprive you of anything of value, but to release you from a bondage which could only deceive and disappoint you in time. Therefore, accepting the hopelessness of your attempt to fulfill yourself opens you finally to receive the great gift which is available to you and which is awaiting you. This great gift is meant to be given through you into the world in a way that is specific for your happiness and for the happiness of those who will naturally be drawn to you.</p><p>否则，你只能在想象中实现你自我，而想象并非现实。接受这一点起初可能会感觉像是一种限制和失望，因为你已经为你自己的个人实现制定了计划和动机，无论这些计划是否已经实现。现在，你对自我成就的整个计划必须受到质疑，不是为了剥夺你任何有价值的成就，而是为了将你从一种只能在时间中欺骗和令你失望的束缚中解放出来。因此，接受你尝试实现你自己的无望，最终会让你开放去接受那个已经为你准备好并在等待你的伟大礼物。这个伟大的礼物旨在通过你以一种特定的方式带到世界上，为你的幸福以及那些自然会被你吸引的人们的幸福服务。</p><p>How can you possibly fulfill yourself? Upon the hour today, repeat this question and give it a moment of serious consideration, regardless of your circumstances. As you practice upon the hour, look out into the world and see how people are trying to fulfill themselves, both in situations that now exist and in situations that are hoped for. Understand how much this separates them from life as it truly exists. Understand how this separates them from the mystery of their own existence and the wonder of life that they are free to encounter every moment of every day. Do not allow yourself to be so deprived. Fantasy will always paint a grand picture for you, but it has no foundation in reality. Only those who attempt to fortify each other’s fantasies will attempt relationship with each other for this purpose, and their disappointment will be mutual, for which they will be inclined to blame each other. Do not seek, then, that which can only bring you unhappiness and only destroy the great opportunity for relationship for you.</p><p>你怎么可能实现你自己呢？今天每小时重复这个问题，并认真考虑一下，不论你处于何种境况。每小时练习时，看看世界，看看人们如何试图实现自我，无论是在现有的情况下，还是在希望中的情况下。理解这如何将他们与真实的生命分离。理解这如何将他们与他们自己存在的神秘和每天每时每刻都能自由遇见的生命奇迹分离。不要让你自己如此被剥夺。幻想总会为你描绘一幅宏伟的画面，但幻想在现实中没有基础。只有那些试图互相强化彼此幻想的人，才会为了这个目的而尝试建立关系，他们的失望将是相互的，他们将倾向于相互指责。因此，不要去追求那些只会带来不幸并且破坏你伟大关系机会的关系。</p><p>Upon the hour repeat this statement. In your two practice periods, enter stillness and receptivity so that you may learn to receive fulfillment as it truly exists.</p><p>每小时重复这句话。在你的两次练习期间，进入静止和接收状态，以便你能学会收到真正存在的满足。</p><p>Practice 95: Two 30-minute practice periods. Hourly practice.</p><p>练习95：两个 30 分钟的练习时段。每小时练习。</p>]]></content>

      <url>/2024/06/26/94/</url>
      
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="STEP-94-MY-FREEDOM-IS-TO-FIND-MY-PURPOSE"><a href="#STEP-94-MY-FREEDOM-IS-TO-FIND-MY-PURPOSE" class="headerlink" title="STEP 94  MY FREEDOM IS TO FIND MY PURPOSE."></a>STEP 94  MY FREEDOM IS TO FIND MY PURPOSE.</h2><p>What value can freedom possibly have except to enable you to find your purpose and to fulfill it? Without purpose, freedom is merely the right to be chaotic, the right to live without external restraint. But without external restraint, you will merely act out the harshness of your internal restraint. Is this an improvement? Overall it is not an improvement, though it can lead to opportunities for self-discovery.</p><p>自由可能具有怎样的价值，除非它能够让你找到并实现你的目的？没有目的，自由只是混乱的权利，只是没有外部约束地生活的权利。但是没有外部约束，你只会表现出你内在约束的严酷性。这是改善吗？总体而言，这不是一种改善，尽管它可以带来自我发现的机会。</p><p>DO NOT CALL CHAOS FREEDOM, for this is not freedom. Do not think that because others do not limit you that you are in an exalted state. Realize that your freedom is to enable you to find your purpose and to fulfill it. Understanding freedom in this way will enable you to utilize all aspects of your life—your current situation, your relationships, your involvements, your successes, your errors, your attributes and your limitations—everything on behalf of discovering your purpose. For when a greater purpose begins to express itself through you in a manner that you can recognize and accept, you will feel at last that your life is being completely integrated. You will no longer be separate individuals within yourself, but one person, whole and unified, with all aspects of yourself engaged in serving this one purpose.</p><p>不要称混乱为自由，因为这不是自由。不要认为因为其他人不限制你，你就处于一种崇高的状态。要意识到你的自由是为了让你找到并实现你的目的。以这种方式理解自由，将使你能够使用生命的各个方面——你当前的情况、你的人际关系、你的参与、你的成功、你的错误、你的属性和你的局限——一切都为了发现你的目的。当一个更伟大的目的开始通过你表达出来，以一种你可以识别和接受的方式时，你最终会感到你的生命得到了完全的整合。你将不再在自己的内部分裂，而是一个人，完整且统一，所有方面都参与服务于这个目的。</p><p>The freedom to commit errors will not redeem you. Errors can be committed under any circumstances, and freedom can be found under any circumstances. Therefore, seek to learn about freedom. Knowledge will express itself when it is unfettered and when you as a person have developed sufficiently to be able to carry its great mission in the world. Your Spiritual Teachers, who abide with you beyond your visual sight, are here to initiate you into Knowledge. They have their own method for doing this, for they understand the true meaning of freedom and its true purpose in the world.</p><p>犯错的自由不会拯救你。错误可以在任何情况下犯下，自由也可以在任何情况下找到。因此，寻求学习自由。内识会在不受束缚时表达自己，而当你作为一个人已经足够发展以承载它在世界上的伟大使命时，你的精神老师，他们超越你视觉视野的存在，正在这里引导你进入内识。他们有自己的方法，因为他们理解自由的真实含义及其在世界上的真实目的。</p><p>Therefore, in your practice periods We once again affirm the power of this statement and give you two opportunities to experience it deeply within yourself. You do not need to try to speculate about this mentally, but simply relax so that it can be experienced. Focus your mind completely to allow it to experience the greatness of the presence of God that is with you and that is within you, for this is looking in the direction of freedom where freedom truly exists.</p><p>因此，在你的练习期间，我们再次确认这一陈述的力量，并给你两次机会在内心深处体验它。你不需要试图在心智上去推测，而是简单地放松以便体验。完全专注于让自己感受到上帝的伟大存在，因为这是朝向真正自由的方向。</p><p>Practice 94: Two 30-minute practice periods.</p><p>练习94：两个 30 分钟的练习时段</p>]]></content>

You have come here for a purpose, to remember your True Home while you are in the world. The great purpose that you carry is with you at this moment, and it will arise in stages as you undergo the preparation that We are providing for you. This purpose is greater than all the purposes you have imagined for yourself. It is greater than all the purposes you have attempted to live for yourself. It does not need your imagination or your creations, for it will fulfill itself through you and will integrate you perfectly as it does so. There is a purpose for you to fulfill in the world. You are now preparing step by step to experience and to learn to accept this so that it may yield its great gifts to you.</p><p>你被派往这个世界是有目的的，那就是贡献出你的礼物，这些礼物将从内识中散发出来。你来到这里是有目的的，那就是在你来到这个世界的时候，记住你真实的家。此时此刻，你的伟大使命与你同在，它将随着你收到我们为你提供的准备工作而分阶段出现。这个目的比你为自己所想象的所有目的都要伟大。它比你试图为自己实现的所有目的都要伟大。它不需要你的想象或创造，因为它会通过你实现它自己，并在实现过程中完美地融入你。在这个世界上，有一个目的需要你去实现。你现在正一步一步地准备去体验并学会接受它，这样它就会向你交付它的伟大礼物。</p><p>In your two practice periods, affirm the reality of this statement. In stillness and receptivity, allow your mind to settle into its true function. Allow yourself to be a student, which means allowing yourself to be receptive and responsible for utilizing that which is provided for you. Let this day be an affirmation of your true life in the world, not the life that you have made for yourself.</p><p>在你的两次练习中，确认这句话的真实性。在静心和接纳的状态下，让你的心沉淀下来，发挥它真实的功能。让自己成为一名学生，这意味着让自己善于接受并负责任地使用为你提供的一切。让这一天成为你在世界上真实生命的肯定，而不是你为自己创造的生命。</p><p>Practice 93: Two 30-minute practice periods.</p><p>练习 93：两个 30 分钟的练习时段</p>]]></content>

You have come to serve the world in its present needs.  You have come to prepare for future generations. Can all of this be meaningful to you personally now? Perhaps not, because you are working for the present and for the future. You are working for the life that you will live and for lives that will follow yours. This is fulfilling to you now, for this is your gift that you have come to give. Without pretense and without uncertainty, this will arise from you naturally and will give itself into the world. Weaving your life with other lives in a very specific way, it is meant to uplift you and all with whom you come in contact. The Plan is greater than your personal ambition, and only your personal ambition can cloud your vision of what you must do. Be thankful, then, today that there is a role for you to fulfill in the world. You have come into the world to fulfill this role—for your own fulfillment, for the advancement of your world and for service to your Spiritual Family.</p><p>你在一个至关重要的时刻来到这个世界。你来服务当下世界的需求。你来为后代做准备。所有这些对你现在是否有意义呢？也许不是，因为你为现在和未来而工作。你为将要生活的世界上的生命，以及接下来将跟随你的生命而工作。这对你来说现在是充实的，因为这是你来给予的礼物。没有伪装，没有不确定性，这将自然地从你身上升起，并投入到世界中去。它以一种非常特殊的方式将你的生命与其他生命交织在一起，这意味着让你和你接触过的所有人都得到提升。这计划比你个人的野心更为伟大，只有你的个人野心才会模糊你必须做的事情的视野。因此，今天要感恩，感恩有一个角色让你在世界上履行。你来到这个世界上来履行这个角色——为了你自己的满足，为了你世界的进步以及为了服务你的精神家庭。</p><p>In your two practice periods today, concentrate and affirm that there is a role for you to play. Do not attempt to fill in that role according to your ideas or your wishes, but allow that role to fulfill itself, for Knowledge within you will fulfill it once you are prepared. In stillness and acceptance, affirm that there is a role for you to play in the world and experience the power and the truth of this great idea.</p><p>在你今天的两个练习时间中，集中注意力并确认你有一个角色要扮演。不要试图按照你的想法或愿望去填补这个角色，而是让这个角色自己实现，因为一旦你准备好了，你内在的内识就会实现它。在静心和接纳中，确认你在这个世界上有一个角色要扮演，并体验这个伟大想法的力量和真理。</p><p>Practice 92: Two 30-minute practice periods.</p><p>练习 92：两个 30 分钟的练习时段</p>]]></content>

Give this time to re-experience what happened each and every day and to see this from your current experience as well. Learn how to learn. Learn about the process of learning. Do not use learning as a form of showmanship. Do not use learning to try to prove your worth to yourself. You cannot prove your worth. It is beyond your efforts to prove it. Your worth will demonstrate itself when you allow it, which you are now learning to do. Practice to practice. Some days will be easier. Some days will be harder. Some days you will want to practice. Other days you may not want to practice. Each day you practice because you are representing a Greater Will. This demonstrates consistency, which is a demonstration of power. This demonstrates a greater dedication. This gives you certainty and stability and allows you to deal compassionately with all things of lesser strength.</p><p>我们的回顾将再次集中于过去一周的指导和你的练习。花时间重新体验每一天所发生的事情，并从你当前的经验中看待这些事情。学习如何学习。了解学习的过程。不要将学习作为一种炫耀的形式。不要用学习来证明自己的价值。你无法证明自己的价值，这超出了你的努力范围。当你允许时，你的价值将自我显现，而你现在正在学习如何做到这一点。练习就是为了练习。有些日子会更容易。有些日子会更困难。有些日子你会想要练习，其他日子你可能不想练习。你每天都练习，因为你代表着更伟大的意志。这展示了一种一致性，这是一种力量的展示。这展示了更大的奉献精神。这给你带来了确定性和稳定性，并允许你以同情心处理所有较弱的事物。</p><p>Your long Review today will be an examination of your learning process. Remember not to judge yourself so that you may learn.</p><p>今天的长时间复习将是对你学习过程的检视。记住不要评判自己，以便你能学习。</p><p>Practice 91: One long practice period.</p><p>练习91：一个长时间的练习</p>]]></content>

Make no assumptions about your progress in learning. Make no assumptions about your world. Practice this day having an open mind that bears witness to events and that seeks to learn. Enjoy the freedom that comes without assumptions, for mystery will be a source of grace for you rather than a source of fear and anxiety as you learn to receive it.</p><p>今天，当你为内识的开垦再奉献一天时，请不要做任何假设。对你的学习进度不作任何假设。对你的世界不做任何假设。在这一天里，以开放的心态见证各种事件，并努力学习。享受没有假设带来的自由，因为当你学会接受神秘时，神秘将成为你恩典的来源，而不是恐惧与焦虑的来源。</p><p>In your hourly practice and in your two longer meditation practices today, where you practice stillness and receptivity, you can experience the value and the power of these words.

They pull you from place to place. Perhaps in time you will be able to understand their mechanism more thoroughly. Our practice today is to emphasize that they do not control Knowledge. Knowledge does not need to destroy your emotions. It only wishes to contribute to them. In time, you will come to understand a great deal more about your emotions, and you will realize that your emotions may serve a greater purpose, as may your mind and your body. All things that have been a source of pain, discomfort and disassociation, when brought into service to one power—which is the One Power—will then become vehicles of expression serving a greater purpose. Even anger serves a greater purpose here, for it shows you that you have violated Knowledge. Though your anger may not be directed towards another, it is simply a sign that something has gone wrong and that correction has to be made. You will understand the source of grief, and you will understand the source of all emotions in time.</p><p>情感像强风一样吸引着你。情感将你从一个地方拉到另一个地方。也许随着时间的推移，你会更加彻底地理解情感的机制。我们今天的练习是强调情感并不控制内识。内识不需要摧毁你的情感。它只希望对你的情感有所贡献。随着时间的推移，你会对情感有更多的理解，你会意识到你的情感可以服务于一个更伟大的目的，就像你的心灵和身体一样。所有曾经带来痛苦、不适和分裂的事物，当它们服务于一个力量——即唯一的力量时，将会成为表达的一种载体，服务于更伟大的目的。即使是愤怒在这里也有更大的目的，因为它显示出你违反了内识。尽管你的愤怒可能并没有指向他人，但它只是一个信号，表明出了问题，需要进行纠正。你会理解悲伤的来源，并且最终你会理解所有情感的来源。</p><p>Practice upon the hour and at the beginning of your two longer meditation periods, repeat today’s idea and then enter into stillness. Today learn to value that which is certain and to understand that which is uncertain, to recognize that which is cause and that which obstructs cause but which may in time serve cause itself.</p><p>每小时练习一次，在两次较长的冥想开始时，重复今天的想法，然后进入静心状态。今天，学会珍视确定的内识，并理解不确定的情感，识别原因和阻碍原因的情感，而这些阻碍的情感可能最终也会服务于原因它本身。</p><p>Practice 89: Two 30-minute practice periods.

This is very hard to resolve from the point of view of separation. But when you think of life as an inclusive network of evolving relationships, you then begin to experience and recognize that your Higher Self is indeed part of a greater fabric of relationship. It is the part of you that is not separate but is meaningfully bonded with others. Therefore, your Higher Self is bonded to the Higher Self of your Teachers. They are without duality now, for they have no other self. You have two selves: the Self that has been created and the self that you have created. To bring the self that you have created into service to your True Self joins them together into a meaningful marriage of purpose and service and ends internal conflict forever.</p><p>关于你的高我和你的精神导师，经常会有混淆。从分离的角度来看，这很难解决。但是，当你把生命看作是一个不断演化的关系网络时，你就会开始体验并认识到，你的高我的确是更大的关系结构的一部分。它是你的一部分，不是独立的，而是与他人有意义地结合在一起。因此，你的高我与你的老师们的高我结合在一起。他们现在没有二元性，因为他们没有另一个自我。你有两个自我：被创造的自我和你创造的自我。将你所创造的自我带入对真实自我的服务中，将它们结合在一起，形成一个有意义的目标和服务的结合，从而永远结束内心的冲突。</p><p>Today upon the hour repeat your affirmation and feel its impact. In your two longer practice periods, use your affirmation as an introduction to your practice in stillness and receptivity.</p><p>今天每小时重复你的肯定语，感受它的影响。在两次较长时间的练习中，将你的肯定语作为你静心和接纳练习的引子。</p><p>Practice 88: Two 30-minute practice periods.

Upon the hour you will learn to release fear from your life, for Knowledge will dispel all fear, and you will dispel fear to give Knowledge its right to express itself. Trust what you know. It is for the greatest good. You may bear great anger and distrust towards yourself, but this is not directed at Knowledge. This is directed at your personal mind, which cannot possibly understand your greater purpose. It cannot possibly answer your greatest questions or provide certainty, purpose, meaning and direction in your life. Forgive what is fallible. Honor what is infallible. And learn to tell the two apart.</p><p>今天的每一个小时，练习重复这句话，并思考它的含义。在这一小时里，你将学会从生命中释放恐惧，因为内识会驱散一切恐惧，你将驱散恐惧，让内识有权表达它自己。相信你的内识。这是为了最大的利益。你可能会对自己充满愤怒和不信任，但这并不是针对内识的。它针对的是你的个人心智，因为它不可能理解你更伟大的目标。它不可能回答你最大的问题，也不可能为你的人生提供确定性、目的、意义和方向。原谅易错之处。尊重无懈可击的内识。并学会将两者区分开来。</p><p>In your two longer practice periods today, practice letting go of fear so that you may know. Allowing your mind to be still and receptive without making demands will be a demonstration that you are trusting Knowledge. It will give you reprieve from the afflictions and the animosities of this world. With this, you will begin to see a different world.</p><p>在今天两次较长时间的练习中，练习放下恐惧，这样你就可以知道。让你的心静止下来，接受而不提出要求，这将是你信任内识的表现。这将使你从这个世界的痛苦和敌意中解脱出来。这样，你将开始看到一个不同的世界。</p><p>Practice 87: Two 30-minute practice periods.

Today in your two deep practice periods, you are asked to think of those people who have given to you, to think of them and nothing else during your period of practice. You are asked to consider very deeply what they have done for you. With those with whom you are angry and upset, try to see how they, too, have given service to you in the reclamation of Knowledge. Do not bear false witness against your feelings, but in spite of your feelings towards them, if there are ill feelings, attempt also to recognize their service to you. For you can indeed be angered or upset by someone that you recognize has served you, and this is often the case. Perhaps you will even be angry at this curriculum which seeks only to serve you. Why would you be angry at this curriculum? Because Knowledge flushes out everything that stands in its way. That is why at times you are angry and do not even know why.</p><p>尊敬那些为你付出的人，会让你产生感激之情，而这正是真爱和感恩的开始。今天，在你的两次深度练习中，要求你想想那些为你付出的人，在练习期间只想他们，不想其他。你要深入思考他们为你所做的一切。对于那些让你感到愤怒和不安的人，试着看看他们也是如何在内识的开垦过程中为你服务的。不要对你的感情作虚假的见证，尽管你对他们有感情，如果有不愉快的感觉，也要试着承认他们对你的服务。因为你确实会被某个你承认曾为你服务过的人激怒或难过，这种情况经常发生。也许你甚至会对这门只为你服务的课程感到愤怒。你为什么会对这门课程感到愤怒呢？因为内识会冲走一切阻碍它的障碍。这就是为什么有时你会生气，甚至不知道为什么生气。</p><p>Allow your two practice periods to be quite focused. Concentrate. Use the power of your mind. Think of those individuals who have served you. If individuals come to mind whom you had not considered having served you, think how they have served you as well. Let this day be a day of recognition. Let this be a day of restitution.</p><p>让你的两次练习课相当专注。集中注意力。运用你心灵的力量。想想那些曾经为你服务过的人。如果你想到了一些你不曾想过曾为你服务过的人，想想他们是如何为你服务的。让今天成为一个承认的日子。让这一天成为一个弥补的日子。</p><p>Practice 86: Two 30-minute practice periods.</p><p>练习 86：两个 30 分钟的练习时段</p>]]></content>

You will find happiness in  small things because you are learning to be still and observant. You will find happiness in small things because your mind is becoming receptive. You will experience happiness in small things because you are being present to your current circumstances. Small things can carry great messages if you are attentive to them. Then small things will not aggravate you.</p><p>你会在小事中找到快乐，因为快乐与你同在。你会在小事中发现幸福，因为你正学会静下来观察。你会在小事中发现幸福，因为你的心灵变得善于接纳。你会在小事中体验到幸福，因为你正在面对当前的环境。如果你细心观察，小事也能蕴含巨大的信息。这样，小事就不会让你感到烦躁。</p><p>A still mind is an aware mind. A still mind is a mind that is learning to be at peace. Peace is not a passive state. It is a state of the greatest activity, for it engages your life with great purpose and intensity, activating all of your powers and giving them uniform direction. This comes from peace. God is still, but everything from God is generated into constructive and uniform action. This is what gives form and direction to all meaningful relationships. This is why your Teachers are with you, for there is a Plan.</p><p>静心就是察觉的心。静止的心是一种学会平和的心。平静不是一种被动的状态。它是一种最活跃的状态，因为它使你的生命充满目的性和强度，激活你所有的力量，并给予它们统一的方向。这源于和平。上帝是静止的，但来自上帝的一切都会产生建设性的统一行动。这就是所有有意义的关系的形式和方向。这就是你的老师与你在一起的原因，因为有一个计划。</p><p>Practice stillness twice today in deep meditation. State your lesson’s affirmation upon the hour and consider it briefly. Allow your day to be given to practice, so practice can infuse itself into all of your other activities. </p><p>今天，在深度冥想中练习静心两次。每时每刻说出你的课程申明，并进行简要思考。让你的一天都用来练习，这样练习就能渗透到你所有的其他活动中。</p><p>Practice 85: Two 30-minute practice periods.

Review your progress objectively. Realize how great your learning must be. Your steps now are small, but substantive. Small steps lead you all the way. You are not expected to take great leaps, yet each small step will seem like a great leap, for it will give you so much more than you have ever had before. Allow your external life to become rearranged as your inner life begins to emerge and to shine its light upon you. Maintain your focus and accept change in your outer life, for it is for your benefit. Only if Knowledge is violated will the indication of error be evident to you. This will lead you to effective action. If Knowledge is not offended by the change around you, then you need not be. In time, you will achieve the peace of Knowledge. You will share in its peace, its certainty and its true gifts.</p><p>回顾上一周的练习和指导。客观地回顾自己的进步。认识到自己的学习成果有多大。你现在迈出的步子虽小，但却很实在。小步引领你前进。我们不期望你有大的飞跃，但每一小步都会让你觉得是一个巨大的飞跃，因为它将带给你前所未有的收获。当你的内在生命开始萌发并向你发出光芒时，让你的外在生活得到重新安排。保持专注，接受外在生活的改变，因为这对你有益。只有当内识受到侵犯时，你才会发现错误的迹象。这将引导你采取有效的行动。如果内识没有被你周围的变化所冒犯，那么你也不必如此。假以时日，你将获得内识的平静。你将分享它的和平、它的确定性和它真实的礼物。</p><p>Therefore, conduct your review in one long practice period today. Review with great emphasis and discrimination. Do not allow yourself to miss the recognition of your learning process.</p><p>因此，今天就在漫长的练习中进行复习吧。以高度的重视和辨别力进行复习。不要让自己错过对学习过程的认识。</p><p>Practice 84: One long practice period.</p><p>练习 84： 长时间练习</p>]]></content>

It would erase all conflicts in your thinking. It would end completely all that troubles you and perplexes you. You would not view relationships either as a form of domination or as a form of punishment. This would give you an entirely new basis of understanding in your participation with others. It would give you a frame of reference within which you would be able to develop yourself mentally and physically, keeping a greater perspective as you do so. What has disappointed you but the misappropriation of your abilities? What grieves and angers you but the misappropriation of other people’s abilities?</p><p>如果你能体验到这句话的深度和力量，你就能摆脱一切形式的束缚。它会消除你思维中的所有冲突。它将彻底终结你所有的烦恼和困惑。你不会再把人际关系视为一种支配或惩罚。这将为你与他人的交往提供一个全新的理解基础。它将为你提供一个参照系，让你在身心发展的同时，保持更高的视野。除了能力被滥用，还有什么让你失望？除了挪用他人的能力，还有什么让你悲伤和愤怒？</p><p>Value Knowledge. It is beyond your understanding. Follow Knowledge. It guides you in ways that you have never experienced. Trust Knowledge. It gives you back to yourself. Trust comes before understanding, always. Participation comes before trust, always. Therefore, participate with Knowledge.</p><p>重视内识。它超越了你的理解。追随内识。它以你从未体验过的方式指引你。信任内识。它让你回归自我。信任永远先于理解。参与永远先于信任。因此，与内识一起参与。</p><p>Remind yourself of your affirmation upon the hour. Try to be very consistent. Do not forget today to emphasize that you value Knowledge above all other things. In your two meditation practices, give this statement as an affirmation and then, in stillness, allow yourself to receive. Do not use these practices to gain answers or information, but allow yourself to become quiet, for a quiet mind can learn all things and know all things. Words are but one form of communication. You are now learning to communicate, for your mind is now opening to a greater association.</p><p>每小时提醒自己肯定。尽量保持一致。不要忘记今天强调你珍视内识胜过一切。在两次冥想练习中，将这个声明作为肯定，并在静心中，让自己接受。不要利用这些练习来获取答案或信息，而是让自己保持安静，因为安静的心灵可以学到一切并知道一切。言语只是沟通的一种形式。你现在正在学会沟通，因为你的心灵现在正在向一个更大的联系敞开。</p><p>Practice 83: Two 30-minute practice periods.

Judgment is a decision not to know. It is a decision not to look. It is a decision not to listen. It is a decision not to be still. It is a decision to follow a convenient form of thinking that keeps your mind asleep and keeps you lost within the world. The world is full of error. How could it be otherwise? Therefore, it does not require your condemnation but your constructive assistance.</p><p>我们再次练习这一课，在你学习的过程中，我们会每隔一段时间重复这一课。评判是一种不知道的决定。这是不去观察的决定。这是不倾听的决定。这是不静心的决定。它决定遵循一种方便的思维方式，让你的心灵沉睡，让你迷失在这个世界里。这个世界充满了错误。怎么可能不是这样呢？因此，它不需要你的谴责，而需要你建设性的帮助。</p><p>Do not judge another today. Remind yourself of this upon each hour and consider it briefly. Remind yourself of this in your two meditation practices, where you make this statement and then enter into stillness and receptivity. Do not judge another today so that you may be happy.</p><p>今天，不要评判他人。每个小时都要提醒自己这一点，并简短地思考一下。在你的两次冥想练习中提醒自己这一点，在冥想练习中你会做出这样的声明，然后进入静心和接受状态。今天不要评判他人，这样你才会快乐。</p><p>Practice 82: Two 30-minute practice periods. Hourly practice.</p><p>练习 82：两个 30 分钟的练习时段。每小时练习一次。</p>]]></content>

Strengthen your commitment to Knowledge. Do not fall into the apparent ease of self-deception. Do not be comfortable merely with assumptions or the beliefs of others. Do not accept generalities as truth. Do not accept appearances as representative of the reality of another. Do not accept the mere appearance of yourself. Doing these things demonstrates that you do not value yourself or your life and that you are too indolent to carry forth effort on your own behalf.</p><p>一小时后，练习说这句话，感受它的影响。加强你对内识的承诺。不要轻易陷入自欺。不要仅仅满足于假设或他人的信念。不要把泛泛之谈当作真理。不以表象代表他人的真实。不要只接受自己的表象。做这些事表明，你不重视自己或自己的生命，你太懒惰，无法为自己付出努力。</p><p>You must enter uncertainty to find Knowledge. What does this mean? It simply means you are giving up false assumptions, self-comforting ideas and the luxury of selfcondemnation. Why is self-condemnation a luxury? Because it is easy and does not require you to examine the truth. You accept it because it is acceptable in this world, and it gives you a great deal to talk about with your friends. It evokes sympathy. Therefore, it is easy and weak.</p><p>你必须进入不确定性，才能找到内识。这意味着什么？简单地说，就是你要放弃错误的假设、自我安慰的想法和自我谴责的奢望。为什么自我谴责是一种奢侈？因为它很容易，不需要你去审视真理。你接受它是因为在这个世界上它是可以被接受的，而且它还能让你和朋友们有很多话题可以聊。它能唤起同情。因此，它既简单又脆弱。</p><p>Do not deceive yourself today. Allow yourself to examine the mystery and the truth of your life. Upon the hour today repeat today’s idea and feel what it means. Also today, in two longer practice periods, repeat the statement and then dedicate yourself to stillness and receptivity. By now, you are beginning to learn how to prepare yourself for stillness—using your breath, concentrating your mind, relinquishing thoughts and reminding yourself that you are worthy of such an effort. Remind yourself of the goal that you are attempting to reach. Do not deceive yourself today. Do not give in to what is easy and painful.</p><p>今天，不要欺骗自己。让自己审视生命的神秘和真理。今天的每一小时，重复今天的想法，感受它的含义。同样在今天，在两个较长的练习时间里，重复这句话，然后专注于静心和接受。现在，你已经开始学习如何为静止做好准备——运用呼吸、集中精神、放弃杂念，并提醒自己，你值得付出这样的努力。提醒自己要达到的目标。今天不要欺骗自己。不要屈服于容易和痛苦的事物。</p><p>Practice 81: Two 30-minute practice periods. Hourly practice.</p><p>练习 81： 两个 30 分钟练习时段。每小时练习一次。</p>]]></content>

You are stepping back from judgment and becoming a witness of life within you and of life around you. Accept uncertainty today so that you may learn. Without presumption, you will seek Knowledge. Without judgment, you will realize your own true need.</p><p>允许不确定性的存在，意味着极大的信心。这意味着另一种形式的确定性正在产生。当你允许不确定性存在时，意味着你变得诚实，因为事实上你是不确定的。允许不确定性的存在，意味着你变得有耐心，因为重新获得确定性需要耐心。允许不确定性的存在，意味着你变得宽容。你从评判中退后一步，成为你内心和周围生命的见证者。今天就接受不确定性吧，这样你才能学到内识。不妄自菲薄，你将寻求内识。没有评判，你会意识到自己真实的需要。</p><p>Upon each hour today, repeat today’s statement and examine what it means.

Once again examine the qualities within yourself which aid you in your preparation and the qualities within yourself that make your preparation more difficult. Observe these things objectively. Learn to strengthen those aspects of yourself that encourage and strengthen your participation in the reclamation of Knowledge, and learn to adjust or correct those qualities that interfere. You must recognize both to have Wisdom.You must learn of truth and you must learn of error.You must do this to progress, and you must do this to serve others. Unless you have learned of error and can look at it objectively and understand how it has arisen and how it can be relieved—until you have learned these things—you will not know how to serve others, and their errors will anger you and frustrate you.

Knowledge represents a greater judgment, but it is a judgment that is very different from your own, for it is not born of fear. It does not possess anger. It is always meant to serve and to nourish. It is just, in that it gives true recognition to every person’s current state without belittling their meaning or their destiny.</p><p>如果没有你的判断，内识可以指明你必须做什么，必须理解什么。内识代表了一种更大的判断力，但这种判断力与你的判断力截然不同，因为它不是出于恐惧。它没有愤怒。它总是为了服务和滋养。它是公正的，因为它真实承认每个人的现状，而不会贬低他们的意义或命运。</p><p>DO NOT JUDGE THE WORLD TODAY so that you may see the world as it is. Do not judge the world today so that you may accept the world as it is. Allow the world to be exactly as it is so that you can recognize it. Once the world has been recognized, you will realize how much it needs you and how much you will want to give to it. The world does not need blame. It needs service. It needs truth.

It is very difficult for a mind that is restless to be patient. It is very difficult for a mind that has sought all of its worth from temporary things to be patient. Only in the pursuit of something greater is patience necessary because it requires a greater application. Think of your life in terms of long-term development, not in terms of immediate sensation and gain. Knowledge is not merely stimulation. It is the depth of power that is universal and eternal, and its greatness is given to you to receive and to give.</p><p>对于一个受折磨的心灵来说，要保持耐心非常困难。对于一个不安宁的心灵来说，要保持耐心非常困难。对于一个将自身价值寄托于暂时事物的心灵来说，要保持耐心非常困难。只有在追求更大的内识时，耐心才是必要的，因为它需要更大的付出。从长远发展的角度来考虑你的生活，而不是从眼前的感觉和利益的角度来考虑。内识不仅仅是刺激。它是普遍而持久的深层力量，它的伟大在于你的接受和给予。</p><p>PRACTICE EACH HOUR TODAY affirming that you will learn to be patient and that you will become observant of your life rather than critical of your life.

You who have lived under the weight of your own imagination, you who have been a prisoner to your own thoughts and to the thoughts of others, you who have been intimidated and threatened by the appearances of this world now have hope, for true freedom abides within you. It awaits you. You have brought it with you from your Ancient Home. You carry it with you each day, each moment.</p><p>自由就在你心中，等待着在你心中诞生，等待着你去索取和接受，等待着你去生活和运用，等待着你去尊重和追随。你曾生活在自己想象力的重压之下，你曾被自己的想法和他人的想法所囚禁，你曾被这个世界的表象所恐吓和威胁，现在你有了希望，因为真实的自由就在你心中。它在等待着你。你从古老家园带来了它。你每一天、每一刻都带着它。</p><p>WITHIN THIS PROGRAM OF DEVELOPMENT, you are now learning to turn towards freedom and away from fear and the darkness of your own imagination. In freedom, you will find stability and consistency. This will give you the foundation upon which to build your love and sense of self-worth, and this foundation shall not be shaken by the world, for it is greater than the world. It is not born of the misgiving of separation. It is born of the truth of your total inclusion in life.</p><p>在这个发展计划中，你正在学习转向自由，远离恐惧和自己想象中的黑暗。在自由中，你将找到稳定和持续。这将为你奠定爱和自我价值感的基础，这个基础不会被世界动摇，因为它比世界更大。它并非源于分离的疑惑和焦虑。它源于你完全融入生命的真理。</p><p>UPON THE HOUR REPEAT TODAY’S IDEA and take a moment to feel that freedom is with you. As you come closer to freedom throughout the day, you will be able to recognize more and more clearly what holds you back. You will realize that it is but your adherence to your own thoughts that holds you back. It is your interest in your own imagination that holds you back. This will lighten your burden, and you will realize that a true choice is available. This realization will give you the strength to come to freedom today.</p><p>每小时重复今天的想法，花一点时间感受自由与你同在。随着你一天天接近自由，你会越来越清楚地认识到是什么阻碍了你。你会意识到，阻碍你的不过是你对自己想法的坚持。是你对自己想象力的兴趣阻碍了你。这将减轻你的负担，你将意识到真实的选择是存在的。这种认识会给你力量，让你今天就获得自由。</p><p>IN YOUR TWO DEEP MEDITATION PRACTICES, repeat today’s idea and attempt to allow your mind to be still, which is the beginning of its freedom. This practice in stillness will enable your mind to shake loose the chains that bind it—its unforgiveness from the past, its anxiety over the future and its avoidance of the present. In stillness, your mind rises above all that keeps it small, hidden and isolated within its own darkness. How close is freedom to you today who need but be still to receive it. And how great is your reward, you who have come into the world, for freedom is with you.</p><p>在你的两次深思练习中，重复今天的想法，并尝试让你的心灵静下来，这是它自由的开始。这种静止的练习会让你的心灵摆脱束缚它的枷锁——对过去的不原谅、对未来的焦虑和对现在的逃避。在静止中，你的心灵会超越一切使它渺小、隐藏和孤立于自身黑暗之中的束缚。今天，自由离你多么近，你只需静静地接受它。你来到这个世界，自由与你同在，你的奖赏何其丰厚。</p><p>PRACTICE 57: Two 30-minute practice periods.

It justifies blame and condemnation. It establishes expectations of a life that does not yet exist and thus renders you vulnerable to grave disappointment. Your idealism fortifies your condemnation.</p><p>理想主义就是试图不接受世界的现状。它为指责和谴责提供了理由。它使你对尚不存在的生活抱有期望，从而使你容易遭受严重的失望。你的理想主义强化了你的谴责。</p><p>ACCEPT THE WORLD TODAY AS IT IS, not as you want it to be. With acceptance comes love, for you cannot love a world that you want to exist. You can only love a world that exists as it is. Accept yourself now as you exist, and true desire for change and advancement will naturally emerge within you. Idealism justifies condemnation. Recognize this great truth, and you will begin to have a more immediate and profound experience of life and of that which is genuine and not based upon hope or expectation but upon true engagement.</p><p>接受当今世界的现状，而不是你想要的样子。接受就意味着爱，因为你无法爱一个你希望存在的世界。你只能爱一个如实存在的世界。接受你现在的存在，你内心自然会产生真实的改变和进步的愿望。理想主义是谴责的理由。认出这个伟大的真理，你就会开始对生活和真实的生命有更直接、更深刻的体验，这种体验不是基于希望或期待，而是基于真实的参与。</p><p>THEREFORE, IN YOUR TWO 30-MINUTE PRACTICE PERIODS today, concentrate on accepting things exactly as they are. You are not condoning violence, conflict or ignorance in doing this. You are merely accepting the conditions that exist so that you may work with them constructively. Without this acceptance, you have no starting place for true engagement. Allow the world to be exactly as it is, for it is this world that you have come to serve.</p><p>因此，在今天的两次30分钟练习中，集中精力接受事物的本来面目。这样做并不是纵容暴力、冲突或无知。你只是在接受现有的条件，以便建设性地处理它们。没有这种接受，你就没有真实参与的起点。让世界保持原样，因为你要服务的就是这个世界。</p><p>PRACTICE 55: Two 30-minute practice periods.</p><p>练习 55：两个 30 分钟的练习时段</p>]]></content>

Your idealism includes yourself, your relationships and the world in which you live. It includes God and life and all realms of experience that you can imagine. Without experience, there is idealism. Idealism can be helpful at the beginning, for it can start you moving in a true direction, but you must not rest your conclusions or your identity upon it, for only experience can give you that which is true to you and that which you can fully accept. Let not idealism guide you, for Knowledge is here to guide you.</p><p>什么是理想主义，什么是基于失望而希望实现的理想？你的理想主义包括你自己、你的人际关系和你生活的世界。它包括上帝、生命以及你所能想象的所有经验领域。没有经历和体验，就没有理想主义。理想主义在开始时可能会有所帮助，因为它可以让你朝着真实的方向前进，但你绝不能将你的结论或你的身份建立在理想主义之上，因为只有经验才能给你真实适合你、你可以完全接受的身份。不要让理想主义指导你，因为内识就是来指导你的。</p><p>IN YOUR TWO PRACTICE PERIODS TODAY, recognize the extent of your own idealism. Observe carefully what you want yourself to be, what you want your world to be and what you want your relationships to be. Repeat today’s idea and, with eyes closed, examine each of your ideals. Even though your ideals may look beneficial and seem to represent your desire for love and harmony, they in effect hold you back, for they replace that which would truly give you the gifts that you seek.</p><p>在今天的两次练习中，认识到自己理想主义的程度。仔细观察你希望自己成为什么样的人，你希望你的世界是什么样的，你希望你的人际关系是什么样的。重复今天的想法，闭上眼睛，审视你的每一个理想。即使你的理想看起来是有益的，似乎代表了你对爱与和谐的渴望，但它们实际上阻碍了你，因为它们取代了真正能给你带来你所追求的礼物的理想。</p><p>PRACTICE 54: Two 30-minute practice periods.</p><p>练习 54：两个 30 分钟的练习时段</p>]]></content>

This will be viewed as a burden and as a threat until you realize the great meaning that it has and the gift that it really is. It is the salvation of your life. When life reclaims you, you reclaim life and receive all of its rewards, which far exceed anything that you could give yourself. The value of your life is consummated and fully demonstrated through your contribution to others because until contribution exists, you can only partially realize yourself—your value, your purpose, your meaning and your direction.</p><p>你的礼物是用来给予他人的，但首先你必须认识到你的礼物，并将它们与束缚它们、改变它们或否定它们的观念区分开来。除了对他人的贡献，你如何才能了解自己？单独的你什么也做不了。单独的你没有意义。这是因为你并不孤独。这将被视为一种负担和威胁，直到你意识到它的伟大意义和它真正是一份礼物。它是你生命的救赎。当生命重新找回你时，你也就重新找回了生命，并获得了生命的所有回报，这些回报远远超过你自己所能给予的一切。你生命的价值是通过你对他人的贡献来完成和充分展示的，因为在贡献存在之前，你只能部分地实现你自己——你的价值、你的目的、你的意义和你的方向。</p><p>IN YOUR TWO PRACTICE PERIODS TODAY, feel your desire to contribute to others. You do not need now to determine what you wish to contribute. That is not as important as your desire to contribute, for the form of contribution will become evident to you in time and will evolve as well. It is your desire to contribute born of true motivation that will give you joy this day.</p><p>在今天的两次练习中，感受你为他人做贡献的愿望。你现在不需要确定你想贡献什么。这并不重要，重要的是你想贡献的愿望，因为贡献的形式会随着时间的推移逐渐显现出来，并且也会不断发展。你的贡献愿望源于真实的动机，它将给你带来快乐。</p><p>PRACTICE 53: Two 30-minute practice periods.</p><p>练习 53：两个 30 分钟的练习时段</p>]]></content>

If they are ignored or denied, if  they are protected or called by other names, you will not realize the nature of your restraint. You will not understand that which oppresses you. Your life is not born of fear. Your Source is not born of fear. To be able to recognize your fear means that you must realize that you are part of something greater. Realizing this, you can learn to become objective about your life and to understand your present circumstances without self-condemnation, for it is within these circumstances that you must cultivate yourself. You must start from where you are. To do this, you must take inventory of your strengths and weaknesses.</p><p>必须认识到你的障碍，你才能看到它们之外的真理。如果它们被忽视或否认，如果它们被保护或以其他名字称呼，你就不会意识到你限制的本质。你将无法理解压迫你的障碍。你的生命并非源于恐惧。你的源泉并非源于恐惧。要认识到自己的恐惧，就意味着你必须意识到自己是更大生命的一部分。认识到这一点，你就能学会客观地看待自己的生活，了解自己目前的处境，而不自责，因为你必须在这些处境中修炼自己。你必须从自己的现状出发。为此，你必须清点自己的优缺点。</p><p>IN YOUR TWO PRACTICE PERIODS TODAY, evaluate the existence of your fears and remind yourself that your reality is beyond them, but that you must recognize them to understand their damaging presence in your life. Close your eyes and repeat the idea for today; then consider each fear that arises in your mind. Remind yourself that the truth is beyond that specific fear. Allow all fears to arise and be evaluated in this way.</p><p>在今天的两次练习中，评估你的恐惧是否存在，并提醒自己，你的现实是超越它们的，但你必须认出它们，以了解它们在你生命中的破坏性存在。闭上眼睛，重复今天的想法；然后思考脑海中出现的每一种恐惧。提醒自己，真理超越了特定的恐惧。允许所有恐惧出现，并以这种方式进行评估。</p><p>TO BE WITHOUT FEAR, YOU MUST UNDERSTAND FEAR—its mechanism, its influence on people and its result in the world. You must recognize this without deception and without preference. You are a great being working in a limited context, in a limited environment. Understand the limitations of your environment and understand the limitations of your vehicle, and you will no longer hate yourself for being limited.</p><p>要想没有恐惧，你必须理解恐惧——它的机制、它对人的影响以及它在世界上的结果。你必须认识到这一点，不欺骗，不偏爱。你是一个伟大的存在，在有限的背景下，有限的环境中工作。理解你所处环境的局限性，理解你的交通工具的局限性，你就不会再因为自己的局限性而憎恨自己了。</p><p>PRACTICE 51: Two 30-minute practice periods.</p><p>练习 51：两个 30 分钟的练习时段</p>]]></content>

In this Review, it is asked of you to review all seven weeks of practice, reviewing all instructions and recalling your experience of using each one. This may require several longer practice periods, but it is quite essential for you to gain a comprehension of what it means to be a student and how learning is actually accomplished.</p><p>这是完成第七周练习的标志。在这次复习中，要求你回顾所有七周的练习，复习所有说明，并回忆使用每项说明的经验。这可能需要几个较长的练习时间，但这对你理解学生的含义和学习的实际完成方式是非常重要的。</p><p>BE VERY CAREFUL NOT TO JUDGE YOURSELF AS A STUDENT. You are not in a position to judge yourself as a student. You do not have the criteria, for you are not a teacher of Self Knowledge. You will find as you proceed that some of your failures will lead to greater successes, and that some of what you thought of as successes may lead to failures. This will underscore your whole system of evaluation and will lead you to a greater recognition. This will make it possible for you to be compassionate towards yourself and towards others whom you now judge for their successes and their failures.</p><p>不要把自己当作学生来评判。你没有资格把自己当作学生来评判。你没有标准，因为你不是内识的老师。你会发现，你的一些失败会带来更大的成功，而你认为的一些成功可能会导致失败。这将强调你的整个评估系统，并将引导你获得更多的承认。这将使你有可能对自己和他人怀有同情心，你现在对他们的成功和失败作出评价。</p><p>REVIEW, THEN, THE FIRST FORTY-EIGHT LESSONS OF PRACTICE. Try to recall how you responded to each step and how deeply you involved yourself. Try to look at your successes, your accomplishments and your obstacles. You have come this far. Congratulations! You have passed the first test. Be encouraged now to proceed, for Knowledge is with you.</p><p>那么，回顾一下前四十八节练习课吧。试着回忆一下你对每一步的反应，以及你对自己的投入程度。试着看看你的成功、成就和障碍。你已经走到这一步了。祝贺你！你已经通过了第一个考验。现在，请鼓励自己继续前进，因为内识与你同在。</p><p>PRACTICE 49: Several long practice periods.</p><p>练习 49：多次长时间练习</p>]]></content>

It has been waiting for you to reach the point of maturity where you realize its necessity in your life. This engenders true motivation for learning. It is born of recognizing your limitations in light of that which is your true need. You must love yourself to become a student of Knowledge and continually love yourself to proceed. There is no other obstacle to learning but this. Without love there is fear, for nothing else can replace love. But love has not been replaced, and true assistance is available to you.</p><p>真实的指导是可用的。它一直在等待你达到成熟的地步，让你意识到它在你生命中的必要性。这才是真实的学习动力。这是因为你认识到了自己的局限性，而这才是你真实的需要。你必须爱自己，才能成为内识的学生，并不断爱自己，才能继续学习。除了这一点，学习没有其他障碍。没有爱就会有恐惧，因为没有任何恐惧可以取代爱。但是，爱并没有被取代，你可以得到真实的帮助。</p><p>IN YOUR TWO MEDITATION PRACTICES TODAY, attempt to feel the presence of that true assistance. In stillness and in silence, feel this within your life and around you. These meditation practices will begin to open a greater sensitivity within you, a whole new sense. You will begin to discern things that are present, even though you cannot see them. You will be able to respond to ideas and information, even though you cannot hear the source of the message yet. This is the actual process in creative thinking, for people receive ideas; they do not create them. You are part of a greater life. Your personal life is the vehicle for its expression. Your individuality, then, becomes more highly cultivated and more joyful, a prison no longer for you, but the form of your joyful expression.</p><p>在今天的两次冥想练习中，尝试感受真实的帮助存在。在静止和沉默中，在你的生命和周围感受到这一点。这些冥想练习将开启你内心更敏锐的触觉，一种全新的感觉。你将开始辨别那些不可见的存在，即使你看不见它们。你将能够对想法和信息做出回应，尽管你还听不到信息的来源。这就是创造性思维的实际过程，因为人们是接受想法，而不是创造想法。你是更伟大生命的一部分。你的个人生活是其表达的载体。这样，你的个性就会变得更有修养、更快乐，不再是你的牢笼，而是你快乐表达的形式。</p><p>TRUE ASSISTANCE IS AVAILABLE TO YOU. Practice this day feeling its abiding presence in your life.</p><p>你可以获得真实的帮助。每天练习，感受它在你生命中的持久存在。</p><p>PRACTICE 48: Two 30-minute practice periods.</p><p>练习 48：两个 30 分钟的练习时段</p>]]></content>

      <title>第四十七阶：为什么我需要老师？</title>
      <link href="/2024/05/27/47/"/>
      <url>/2024/05/27/47/</url>
      
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="STEP-47-WHY-DO-I-NEED-TEACHERS"><a href="#STEP-47-WHY-DO-I-NEED-TEACHERS" class="headerlink" title="STEP 47  WHY DO I NEED TEACHERS?"></a>STEP 47  WHY DO I NEED TEACHERS?</h2><p>YOU WILL ASK THIS QUESTION SOONER OR LATER and perhaps on many occasions. It is born of your  expectations of yourself that you would ask this question. Yet when you look carefully at your life, you will see that you have required instruction for everything that you have learned. Perhaps things that you felt inside yourself appeared to be created by you, but they, too, are the result of instruction. You have been prepared through relationships for everything that you have learned, whether it be a practical skill or a deeper insight. To realize this engenders great appreciation for relationships and a full affirmation of the power of contribution in the world.</p><p>你迟早会问这个问题，也许会问很多次。你会问这个问题，是因为你对自己抱有期望。然而，当你仔细回顾自己的一生时，你会发现你所学到的一切都需要指导。也许你内心感受到的想法似乎是你自己创造的，但它们也是指导的结果。你所学到的一切，无论是实用的技能还是更深刻的见解，都是通过关系准备好的。认识到这一点，就会对关系产生极大的感激之情，并充分肯定自己在世界上所做贡献的力量。</p><p>IF YOU WERE INTENDING TO HONESTLY APPROACH LEARNING any skill, first you must recognize how much you do not know, then you must recognize how much you need to learn, and then you must seek the best form of instruction possible. This must apply to the reclamation of Knowledge. You must realize how little you know, how much you need to know and then receive the instruction that is provided. Is it a weakness to need a teacher? No. It is an honest recognition based upon an honest evaluation. If you realize how little you know and how much you need to know and the power of Knowledge itself, you will understand how obvious this is. How can you give to those who think they already have, when in reality they are poor? You cannot. And their poverty will be self-inflicted and self-maintained.</p><p>如果你想真诚地学习任何技能，首先你必须认识到你不知道的技能有多少，然后你必须认识到你需要学习的技能有多少，然后你必须尽可能寻求最好的指导方式。这必须适用于内识的开垦。你必须认识到自己知道的有多少，需要学习的有多少，然后接受所提供的指导。需要老师是一种弱点吗？不，这是一种基于诚实评估的诚实认识。如果你意识到自己知道的有多么少，需要知道的有多么多，以及内识本身的力量，你就会明白这一点有多么明显。对于那些自以为已经拥有而实际上却很贫穷的人，你怎么能给予他们帮助呢？你做不到。他们的贫穷是自己造成的，也是自己维持的。</p><p>WHY DO YOU NEED A TEACHER? Because you need to learn. And you need to unlearn that which you have learned that is holding you back. In your two practice periods today, with your eyes closed in meditation, consider why you need a Teacher. Observe any thoughts that seem to indicate that you could do it on your own if you were smart enough or strong enough or met some other qualification. If these expectations arise, recognize them for what they are. They are an insistence that you remain ignorant by proclaiming yourself an adequate instructor. You cannot teach yourself what you do not know, and the attempt to do so merely recirculates old information and binds you closer to where you are now.</p><p>为什么需要老师？因为你需要学习。你需要解除那些阻碍你学习的想法。在今天的两次练习中，闭目冥想，思考你为什么需要老师。观察是否有任何想法似乎表明，如果你足够聪明、足够强大或符合其他一些条件，你就可以自己做到。如果出现这些期望，请认清它们的本质。它们是在坚持要求你继续保持无知，宣称自己是一个足够的指导者。你不可能教自己不知道的东西，而试图这样做只会重复旧的信息，使你更接近现在的状态。</p><p>THEREFORE, IN PRACTICE TODAY RECOGNIZE your need for true instruction and your resistance, if it is there, to the presence of true instruction which is available to you now.</p><p>因此，在今天的练习中，认识到你对真实指导的需求，以及你对真实指导的抗拒（如果有的话）。</p><p>PRACTICE 47: Two 30-minute practice periods.</p><p>练习 47：两个 30 分钟的练习时段</p>]]></content>

It is not a contradiction if you understand its meaning. Recognizing your limitations allows you to work in a limited context very successfully. This demonstrates a greater reality than you could have realized before. Your greatness must not be based merely on hope or high expectation. It must not be founded on idealism but on true experience. Allow yourself to be small, and you will experience that greatness is with you and that greatness is part of you.</p><p>你必须渺小才能伟大，这是否矛盾？如果你理解它的含义，就不会觉得矛盾。认识到自己的局限性，你就能在有限的环境中非常成功地工作。这证明了一个比你以前所能意识到的更大的现实。你的伟大不能仅仅建立在希望或殷切期望之上。它不能建立在理想主义之上，而应建立在真实的经验之上。允许自己渺小，你就会体验到伟大与你同在，伟大是你的一部分。</p><p>IN YOUR TWO PRACTICE PERIODS TODAY, allow yourself to be limited but without judgment. There is no condemnation. Actively engage your mind in focusing on your limitations. Focus without condemnation. Look objectively. You are meant to be a vehicle for a Greater Reality to express itself in this world. Your vehicle for expression is quite limited, but it is fully adequate to accomplish the task that is yours to accomplish. In accepting its limitations, you can understand its mechanism and learn to work with it constructively. Then it is no longer a limitation but a form of joyful expression for you.</p><p>在今天的两次练习中，允许自己受到限制，但不带评判。没有谴责。积极调动你的思维，关注自己的局限性。专注而不谴责。客观地看待问题。你本应是更大现实在这个世界上表达的载体。你的表达载体非常有限，但它完全足以完成你要完成的任务。接受它的局限性，你就能理解它的机制，学会建设性地与它合作。这样，它就不再是一种限制，而是你快乐表达的一种形式。</p><p>PRACTICE 46: Two 15-minute practice periods.</p><p>练习 46：两个 15 分钟的练习时段</p>]]></content>

Nothing has ever been accomplished alone, even in your world. Nothing has ever been created alone, even in your mind. There is no credit to be received by doing something alone. Everything is a joint effort. Everything is the product of relationship.</p><p>你一个人什么也做不了。没有什么能独自完成，即使在你的世界里。没有任何事物是独自创造的，即使是在你的脑海中。单枪匹马是无法取得任何成就的。一切都是共同努力的结果。一切都是关系的产物。</p><p>DOES THIS DEMEAN YOU AS AN INDIVIDUAL? Most certainly not. It gives you the environment and the understanding to realize your true accomplishments. You are greater than your individuality, and thus you may be free of its limitations. You work through the individual that is you personally, but you are greater than this. Accept the limitations of a limited self, and do not require a limited self to be God or you will give it great burdens and great expectations and will then punish it for its failures. This leads to self-hatred. This leads you to resent your physical life and to abuse yourself personally, emotionally and physically. Accept your limitations so that you may accept greatness within your life.</p><p>这并不是贬低你作为一个个体。它为你提供了环境和理解，让你意识到自己真实的成就。你远远超越了个体的局限性，因此你可以摆脱这些限制。你通过个人的方式工作，但你远比个体更伟大。接受有限自我的局限性，不要期望有限的自我成为上帝，否则你会给它巨大的负担和巨大的期望，然后因为它的失败而惩罚它。这会导致自我厌恶。这会让你对自己的生命产生怨恨，并对自己进行人身、情感和身体上的虐待。接受自己的局限性，这样你就可以接受生命中的伟大。</p><p>THEREFORE, IN YOUR TWO PRACTICE PERIODS TODAY, with your eyes open, concentrate now on your limitations. Recognize them. Do not judge them as good or bad. Simply recognize them. This gives you humility, and in humility you are in a position to receive greatness. If you are defending your limitations, how can you receive that which transcends them?</p><p>因此，在今天的两次练习中，睁大你的眼睛，集中精力关注你的局限性。承认它们。不要评判它们的好坏。只需承认它们。这让你变得谦逊，而在谦逊中，你才能获得伟大。如果你为自己的局限性辩护，你怎么能接受局限性之外的关系呢？</p><p>PRACTICE 45: Two 15-minute practice periods. </p><p>练习 45：两个 15 分钟的练习时段</p>]]></content>

You have far more strength than you have claimed, but it cannot be fully realized until its application is directed in a manner that truly regenerates you and brings forth your true abilities.</p><p>由于你在当前情况下的迫切需要，你可能会非常接受这一肯定，但这一肯定远比你一开始意识到的要深刻得多。你所拥有的力量远比你所宣称的要大得多，但只有以真正使你再生并发挥你真实能力的方式来运用它，你才能充分认识到这一点。</p><p>HOW CAN YOU APPROACH YOUR STRENGTH when you feel weak and helpless, when you feel unworthy, if you are burdened by guilt or confusion or in anger blame others for your own apparent failures? To claim your strength means to release all that holds you back. You do not release your obstacles by claiming they do not exist. You release them because you value something greater. Their obstruction is merely the sign that you must pass through them. Your own strength is then cultivated. You seek your strength, and you use it to find your strength. We wish for you to know your strength and to utilize it on your own behalf.</p><p>当你感到软弱和无助时，当你感到不值得时，当你被负罪感或困惑所累时，当你愤怒地将自己的明显失败归咎于他人时，你如何能够接近你的力量呢？宣示你的力量意味着释放所有阻碍你的障碍。你不会因为声称障碍不存在而释放它们。你释放它们是因为你珍视更大的力量。它们的阻碍只是你必须通过它们的标志。这样，你自己的力量就得到了培养。你寻找自己的力量，并用内识来找到自己的力量。我们希望你知道自己的力量，并为自己所用。</p><p>IN YOUR TWO MEDITATION PRACTICES TODAY, in silence and in stillness, attempt to feel your own strength. Do not let thoughts alone dissuade you, for fears and doubts are only thoughts—vaporous things that cross your mind like clouds. Beyond the clouds of your mind is the great universe of Knowledge. Therefore, do not let the clouds obstruct your view of the stars beyond.</p><p>在今天的两次冥想练习中，在静默和寂静中，尝试感受自己的力量。不要让杂念打消你的念头，因为恐惧和疑虑只是杂念——像云朵一样在你脑海中飘过的虚无缥缈的想法。在你思想的云层之外，是伟大的内识宇宙。因此，不要让乌云遮挡你的视线，让你看到外面的星空。</p><p>PRACTICE 44: Two 30-minute practice periods.</p><p>练习 44：两个 30 分钟的练习时段</p>]]></content>

That is your true will. Any other desire or motivation is to escape this, which  represents your will. It is your will that has become fearful to you. You are afraid of what you know and most deeply feel. This leads you to find refuge in other things that do not represent you, and in this you lose your identity and attempt to construct an identity that is related to those things which you have sought for escape. In isolation you are miserable, but in relationship happiness is regained.</p><p>你的意愿是知道上帝。那是你真实的意愿。任何其他欲望或动机都是为了逃避这一点，这代表了你的意志。你害怕你所知道和最深刻感受到的意愿。这导致你寻求在其他事物中寻找避难所，这些事物并不代表你，通过这样做，你失去了自我身份，并试图建立一个与你寻求逃避的事物相关的身份。在孤独中，你是可怜的，但在关系中，幸福重新获得。</p><p>YOUR WILL IS TO KNOW GOD. Do not be afraid of your will. You are created by God. God’s will is to know you. Your will is to know God. There is no other will. All motivations other than this are born merely of confusion and fear. To know God gives God power and gives you power as well.</p><p>你的意愿是知道上帝。不要害怕你的意愿。你是由上帝创造的。上帝的意愿是知道你。你的意愿是知道上帝。没有其他意愿。除此之外的所有动机都只是混乱和恐惧所生。通过知道上帝的力量，来给予你力量。</p><p>IN YOUR TWO PRACTICE PERIODS TODAY, in silent meditation, practice feeling the strength of your own will. Do not let fear and doubt cloud your mind. You need not try to feel the will of God. It is simply there. It only requires your attention for you to recognize it. Therefore, practice deeply by simply being present to this experience.</p><p>在今天的两个实践时段中，在静默的冥想中，练习感受你自己意愿的力量。不要让恐惧和怀疑混淆你的心。你不需要努力去感受上帝的意愿。它就在那里。你只需要注意到它就可以了。因此，通过简单地存在于这种体验中，深入练习。</p><p>PRACTICE 43: Two 30-minute practice periods.</p><p>练习43：两个30分钟的练习时段</p>]]></content>

      <title>第四十二阶：回顾</title>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="STEP-42-REVIEW"><a href="#STEP-42-REVIEW" class="headerlink" title="STEP 42  REVIEW"></a>STEP 42  REVIEW</h2><p>IN YOUR REVIEW TODAY, review all of the instructions given in the past week and your experiences of practice. Take special care today to see how deeply and how carefully you are practicing. Make sure that you are not changing or adjusting the lessons to meet your tastes or expectations. Remember that you need only follow the curriculum to receive its true rewards. Your part is small. Our part is great. We give the means. You need only follow them, in faith and in true expectation. In doing this, you will develop patience, discernment, trust, consistency and self-worth. Why self-worth? Because you must value yourself highly to allow yourself to approach the great gifts of Knowledge. Nothing else will undo self-hatred and self-doubt more expediently and more completely than receiving the gifts that are meant for you.</p><p>在今天的回顾中，审视过去一周所给出的所有指导以及你的实践经验。特别注意今天你练习的深度和仔细程度。确保你没有改变或调整课程以满足你的口味或期望。记住，你只需要遵循课程以获得真正的回报。你的作用很小。我们的作用很大。我们提供手段。你只需信心满满地跟随它们。通过这样做，你将培养出耐心、洞察力、信任、一致性和自我价值感。为什么要自我价值感？因为你必须高度重视自己，才能让自己接近属于你的伟大礼物。没有任何事情比接收那些为你准备的礼物更快地、更彻底地解除自我厌恶和自我怀疑。</p><p>THEREFORE, IN YOUR ONE LONG PRACTICE PERIOD TODAY, review the past week of practice. Without judgment, look and see what has been offered, what you have done and what can possibly be done to deepen your practice so that you may receive its benefits more directly. If you are having difficulty, recognize the problems and attempt to correct them. Give the week ahead greater involvement. In doing so, you will correct self-doubt and confusion merely by directing your will.</p><p>因此，在今天的一个长时间练习期间，回顾过去一周的练习。不带评判地看看已经提供了什么，你做了什么，以及可能做些什么来加深你的练习，使你能够更直接地获得其益处。如果你遇到困难，认识到问题并尝试加以纠正。让未来一周更加投入。通过这样做，你将通过引导自己的意志纠正自我怀疑和困惑。</p><p>PRACTICE 42: One long practice period.</p><p>练习42：一个长时间的练习期</p>]]></content>

For this, you must relinquish your former ideas, assumptions and evaluations of past painful experiences. It is painful to be separated from that which you love beyond all things, and the only way to maintain this separation is to malign that which you love, to give it an evil intent and then to engender guilt within yourself. To feel and accept the power of God, evil and guilt must leave you. You must venture forth to explore that which is most natural. It is like breaking new ground and coming home all at once.</p><p>这个肯定句对你的幸福非常重要，因为你必须再次学会信任爱的力量和上帝的力量。为此，你必须放弃你过去的想法、假设和对过去痛苦经历的评价。被与你最深爱的上帝分离是痛苦的，而保持这种分离的唯一方法就是诋毁你所爱的上帝，给它一个邪恶的意图，然后在你内心产生罪恶感。要感受和接受上帝的力量，邪恶和罪恶必须离开你。你必须勇于探索那些最自然的力量。这就像开辟新天地并一次回到家。</p><p>IN STILLNESS, THEN, PRACTICE TWICE TODAY feeling the power of God. Do not seek for answers from God. You need not speak at all but only be present, for as you learn to be in relationship with that which is the source of all your relationships, the information that you need can come easily to you to guide you, comfort you and correct you when necessary. But first you must feel the power of God, and in this you will find your own strength.</p><p>因此，在安静中，今天练习两次感受上帝的力量。不要从上帝那里寻求答案。你根本不需要说话，只需要在那里存在，因为当你学会与一切关系的源头建立关系时，你所需要的信息可以轻松地来到你这里，指导你、安慰你，并在必要时纠正你。但首先，你必须感受上帝的力量，在这里你会找到自己的力量。</p><p>PRACTICE 41: Two 30-minute practice periods.</p><p>练习41：两个30分钟的练习时段</p>]]></content>

Only those minds that are separated and lost in valuing their own thoughts can possibly be separated from the great benevolence of God. Those who have responded to God become God’s Messengers in time so that they may bestow the gifts of Grace upon those who remain behind in confusion.</p><p>上帝的力量是如此的完整与包容，它渗透到万物之中。只有那些因珍视自己的想法而迷失的心灵，才有可能与上帝的伟大仁慈分离。那些对上帝做出回应的人，会及时成为上帝的使者，以便将恩典的礼物给予那些仍在迷茫中的人。</p><p>ALL THE SEEMING POWERS OF YOUR WORLD—the forces of nature, the inevitability of your death, the ever present threat of illness, loss and destruction and all appearances of conflict— are all temporary movements in the great stillness of God. It is this great stillness that calls you to return to the peace and full enjoyment of God, but you must prepare.</p><p>你在世界上看到所有看似强大的力量——自然的力量，你死亡的必然性，无时不在的疾病、损失和毁灭的威胁，以及所有冲突的表象——都是上帝伟大静止中的暂时运动。正是这伟大的静止召唤着你回到和平之中，充分享受上帝，但你必须做好准备。</p><p>TODAY YOU PREPARE IN YOUR TWO 30-MINUTE practice periods. In silent meditation, attempt to feel the power of God. You do not need to conjure up magical images, for this power is something that you can feel, for it is everywhere. No matter what your circumstances or condition, whether favorable for your development or not, today you can feel the power of God.</p><p>今天你可以在两个30分钟的实践期内做好准备。在静默的冥想中，试图感受上帝的力量。你无需召唤出神奇的形象，因为这种力量是无处不在的。无论你的处境或状态如何，无论是否有利于你的成长，今天你都可以感受到上帝的力量。</p><p>PRACTICE 40: Two 30-minute practice periods.</p><p>练习40：两个30分钟的练习时段</p>]]></content>

It is within your Knowledge. Learn, then, to reclaim your Knowledge, and you will learn to reclaim the power that God has given you, and you will reclaim your power as well, for your power will be necessary for you to approach God’s power. Thus, all that is genuinely powerful and all that which is genuinely good will be affirmed within you and within God. Let this day, then, be a day given to experiencing this presence and this power in your life. You need not imagine God in fantasy. You need not have pictures or images to reinforce your understanding or belief. You need only utilize the practices that are given here.</p><p>上帝的力量与你同在。它存在于你的内识之中。学会重新拥有你的内识，你将学会重新获得上帝赋予你的力量，同时你也将重新获得你自己的力量，因为你的力量将是接近上帝力量所必需的。因此，一切真正有力量和真正善良的关系将在你和上帝之内得到确认。让今天成为一个专注于在你的生命中体验这种存在和力量的一天。你无需在幻想中想象上帝。你无需有图像或形象来加强你的理解或信仰。你只需要利用这里给出的练习。</p><p>IN YOUR TWO DEEP MEDITATION PRACTICES OF 30 minutes each, once again enter into stillness and allow yourself to feel the power of God. Utilize your own power to direct your mind, and do not let doubts or fears dissuade you. The power of God represents the mystery of your life, for it represents the power that you have brought with you from God to be utilized properly in the world according to the Greater Plan. Allow yourself, then, to enter into practice with dedication, with simplicity and with humility so that you may feel the power of God.</p><p>在你的两次深度冥想练习中，每次30分钟，再次进入宁静，让自己感受上帝的力量。利用你自己的力量来引导你的思维，不要让怀疑或恐惧使你动摇。上帝的力量代表着你生命的奥秘，因为它代表着你从上帝那里带来的力量，要根据更大的计划在世界上适当利用。因此，让自己以专注、简单和谦逊的态度进入练习，这样你就能感受到上帝的力量。</p><p>PRACTICE 39: Two 30-minute practice periods.</p><p>练习39：两个30分钟的练习时段</p>]]></content>

How can you know certainty when you value the temporary so greatly? How can you know the power of your own life when you are so intimidated by threats of loss and destruction? Life is kind to you, for it offers not only the reward but the way to the reward. If it were left up to you, it would be cruel indeed, for you would have to attempt every single possibility that you could conceive of, and then you would have the possibilities that others have conceived of and even the opportunities to reach Knowledge that others have used successfully but which may not in fact work well for you. In your brief span of time in the world, how can you accomplish all of these and still maintain your vitality? How can you maintain your encouragement for Knowledge when so many ways will disappoint you?</p><p>当你迷失时，你如何找到自己的路？当你如此看重暂时的事物时，你如何确定？当你如此被损失和毁灭的威胁所吓倒时，你如何知道自己生命的力量？生命对你很仁慈，因为它不仅提供了奖励，还提供了通往奖励的途径。如果一切都交给你来决定，那将是残酷的，因为你将不得不尝试你能想象到的每一个可能性，然后你将有其他人构想的可能性，甚至有机会获得他人成功使用过但实际上对你来说可能不太适用的通往内识的途径。当你还在世界上的短暂时间里，你如何完成所有这些，并仍然保持你的活力？当有那么多的方式会让你失望时，你如何保持对内识的鼓励？</p><p>TAKE FAITH TODAY IN KNOWING THAT GOD knows the way to Knowledge, and you need only follow the way that is being given. In this way, Knowledge simply emerges in you because it is acknowledged, for only God knows Knowledge in you, and only Knowledge in you knows God. As the two resonate together, they both become more apparent. In this, you find peace.</p><p>今天相信内识，因为上帝知道通往内识的路径，你只需要跟随正在给予的路径。通过这种方式，内识在你内在简单地出现，因为它被承认了，因为只有上帝知道你内在的内识，只有你内在的内识知道上帝。当两者共鸣时，它们都变得更加显现。在这种情况下，你会找到平静。</p><p>IN YOUR TWO PRACTICE PERIODS TODAY, each of a 30-minute duration, practice feeling the presence of God, silently, in stillness. Not thinking about God, not speculating, not wondering, not doubting, but simply feeling. It is no fantasy that you are concentrating upon now, though you are used to concentrating upon fantasy. In stillness and quiet, everything becomes apparent. God is very still, for God is not going anywhere. As you become still, you will feel the power of God.</p><p>在今天的两个练习时段中，每个时段持续30分钟，练习在寂静中感受上帝的存在。不是思考上帝，不是推测，不是好奇，不是怀疑，而是简单地感受。你现在专注的不是幻想，尽管你习惯于专注于幻想。在寂静和宁静中，一切都变得明显。上帝是非常静止的，因为上帝无处不在。当你变得静止时，你将感受到上帝的力量。</p><p>PRACTICE 38: Two 30-minute practice periods.</p><p>练习38：两个30分钟的练习时段</p>]]></content>

How can there not be a way for Knowledge to express itself when it is the most natural form of expression? How can there not be a way for Knowledge to guide you in relationships when Knowledge is the perfect source of all your relationships? There is a way to Knowledge. It requires skill and desire. Both will take time to develop. You must learn to value the true and not to value the false, and it takes time to learn to separate the two and to recognize them. It takes time to learn that the false does not satisfy you and that the true does satisfy you. This must be learned through trial and error and through contrast. As you approach Knowledge, your life becomes more full, more certain and more direct. As you go away from it, you re-enter confusion, frustration and anger.</p><p>当内识就是你的真实自我时，怎么会没有通往内识的途径呢？内识是最自然的表达方式，怎么会没有表达方式呢？内识是你所有关系的完美来源，怎么会没有办法让内识在人际关系中指导你呢？通往内识的道路是存在的。它需要技能和渴望。两者都需要时间来培养。你必须学会珍视真实而非虚假，学会将两者区分开来并识别它们需要时间。要学会虚假不能满足你，真实才能满足你，这需要时间。这必须通过反复试验和对比才能学会。当你接近内识时，你的生命会变得更加充实、更加确定、更加直接。当你远离它时，你会重新陷入困惑、沮丧和愤怒。</p><p>IN YOUR TWO PRACTICE PERIODS TODAY, which will not be meditation practices, spend at least 15 minutes thinking of all the ways to gain access to Knowledge. Write down on a piece of paper all the ways to get to Knowledge. Spend both practice periods doing this and exhaust all the possibilities that you can think of. Try to be very specific. Use your imagination, but chart out routes that appear to be quite real and meaningful to you. In this way, you will know what you think about how to find a way to Knowledge, and from this you will realize that God knows the way to Knowledge.</p><p>在今天的两次练习（不是冥想练习）中，至少花15分钟思考获得内识的所有方法。在纸上写下获得内识的所有方法。两个练习时段都这样做，穷尽你能想到的所有可能性。尽量具体。发挥你的想象力，但要描绘出对你来说相当真实和有意义的路线。这样，你就会知道自己对如何找到通往内识之路的看法，并由此认识到上帝知道通往内识的道路。</p><p>PRACTICE 37: Two 15-minute practice periods.</p><p>练习 36 ：两个15分钟的练习时段</p>]]></content>

This is essential for your happiness and fulfillment in the world, for if you have been looking carefully at your life, you will realize you have not been satisfied by little things. For you who seek Knowledge, something greater must be given. You must penetrate the mere surface of things, which seems to adequately stimulate most people. You must accept your deeper yearning or you will cause yourself unnecessary grief and conflict. It is not important what other people value. It is important what you value. If you are seeking for greater meaning, which is true meaning, you must penetrate the surface of your mind.</p><p>确实，你的生命是一个谜，如果你希望理解其目的、其意义和真实的方向，你需要探索它。这对你在世界上的幸福和满足至关重要，因为如果你仔细观察你的生活，你会意识到小事并不能满足你。对于寻求内识的你，必须给予更大的满足。你必须穿透生活的表面，这表面似乎足以刺激大多数人。你必须接受你更深的渴望，否则你将给自己带来不必要的痛苦和冲突。他人重视什么并不重要。重要的是你重视什么。如果你在寻求更大的意义，即真实的意义，你必须穿透你心智的表面。</p><p>IN YOUR TWO PRACTICE PERIODS TODAY, again concentrate in meditation upon feeling the presence of your Spiritual Teachers. This is not something you have to try to do. It simply means relaxing, breathing and allowing your mind to open. The quality of your relationship with your Teachers is essential to give you strength and encouragement, for you may justly doubt your own skills, but you have good cause to fully trust the skills of your Teachers, who have passed this way before on their way to Knowledge. They know the way, which they are seeking now to share with you.</p><p>在今天的两次练习时期中，再次集中冥想，感受你精神老师的存在。这不是你必须尝试去做的事情。这仅仅意味着放松，呼吸并让你的心灵开放。你与导师的关系质量对于给予你力量和鼓励至关重要，因为你可能正当地怀疑自己的技能，但你完全有理由信任你老师的技能，他们之前已经走过这条路，现在正试图与你分享这条路。他们知道前行的道路。</p><p>PRACTICE 36: Two 15-minute practice periods.</p><p>练习36：两个15分钟的练习时段</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="STEP-35-REVIEW"><a href="#STEP-35-REVIEW" class="headerlink" title="STEP 35  REVIEW"></a>STEP 35  REVIEW</h2><p>THIS REVIEW WILL GIVE YOU AN OPPORTUNITY to learn something of The Greater Community Way of Knowledge. In two 30-minute practice periods, review your prior week’s instructions and experiences in practice. Do this with as little judgment as possible. Merely look and see what was instructed, what you did and what the result was. This objective review will give you the greatest access to insight and understanding with a minimum of pain and self-abuse. You are learning now to become objective about your life without repressing the content of your emotions. Instead of attempting to destroy one aspect of yourself, you are simply attempting to cultivate another.</p><p>这次回顾将为你提供一个机会，让你学习一些关于大社区内识之路的知识。在两个30分钟的练习时段中，回顾你前一周的指导和练习经验。尽可能少地进行评判，只是观察和了解被指导的内容、你所做的事以及结果如何。这种客观的回顾将以最小的痛苦和自我虐待，为你提供最大的洞察力和理解。你现在正在学习如何在不压抑情感内容的情况下，对自己的生活保持客观。你不是试图摧毁自己的某一方面，而是简单地尝试培养另一方面。</p><p>THEREFORE, IN YOUR REVIEW, use this as a guidepost: “I will look, but I will not judge.” In this way, you will be able to recognize things. Remember how much easier it may be for you to have insight about another’s life and how little you may have about your own. Greater objectivity is possible with others because you are not attempting to use their life for any specific purpose and the extent to which you are, the less able you will be to understand them, their nature, their development or their destiny. Therefore, the less you attempt to use your life, the more you will be able to understand it, appreciate it and work with its intrinsic mechanism for your greater advancement.</p><p>因此，在你的回顾中，使用这个指导原则：“我会观察，但我不会评判。”通过这种方式，你将能够认识到事物。请记住，对别人的生活有洞察力对你来说可能会更容易，而你对自己的生命却知之甚少。由于你不是出于任何特定目的利用他们的生命，你对他人的客观性可能更强，而你越是这样做，你就越难理解他们、他们的本质、他们的发展或他们的命运。因此，你越少试图利用自己的生命，你就越能理解它、欣赏它，并与其内在机制合作，以促进你更大的进步。</p><p>PRACTICE 35: Two 30-minute practice periods.</p><p>练习35：两个30分钟的练习时段</p>]]></content>

Regardless of how intuitive you may consider yourself,  regardless of how mentally capable you may consider yourself, regardless of how emotionally honest you may consider yourself, no matter what your recognized advancement, you are a beginning student of Knowledge. Be happy that this is so, for beginning students are in a position to learn all things and need not defend their accomplishments. We do not belittle your accomplishments but instead wish to shine the light of truth upon the greatness that waits to be discovered within you, a greatness that will give you true equality in life and in time will reveal what you have come here specifically to do.</p><p>你是一名内识的初学者。无论你认为自己的直觉如何，无论你认为自己的心理能力如何，无论你认为自己在情感上如何诚实，无论你认识的进步程度如何，你都是内识的初级学生。要为这一点感到高兴，因为初学的学生有能力学习所有的课程，不需要为他们的成就辩护。我们不是在贬低你的成就，而是希望在你内在的伟大上照亮真理的光芒，这种伟大将给你真实的平等，并将随着时间的推移揭示你特别来这里要做的事情。</p><p>IN YOUR TWO PRACTICE PERIODS, begin by acknowledging to yourself that you are a beginning student of Knowledge and by reminding yourself to make no premature conclusions either about this curriculum or about your abilities as a student. Such judgments are premature and rarely reflect the truth in any way. They are usually a form of self-discouragement and thus serve no worthy purpose at all.</p><p>在你的两个练习时段中，首先承认你是内识的初学者，并提醒自己不要对这个课程或你作为学生的能力做出过早的结论。这样的判断是不成熟的，很少以任何方式反映真理。它们通常是一种自我打击的形式，因此根本没有任何值得的目的。</p><p>AFTER DECLARING TODAY’S IDEA TO YOURSELF and reminding yourself not to judge, practice 15 minutes of inner stillness in your two practice periods. Attempt to feel the truth within you. Focus your mind on one point, either a physical point or an imaginary point if necessary. Let everything settle down inside. Let yourself become as quiet as possible, and do not be discouraged if there is difficulty. You are a beginning student of Knowledge and thus can learn all things.</p><p>在向自己宣告今天的想法并提醒自己不要评判之后，在你的两个练习时段中练习15分钟的内心静止。尝试感受你内在的真理。将你的注意力集中在一个点上，无论是物理点还是必要时的想象点。让内心的一切都平静下来。尽可能让自己变得安静，如果有困难，不要气馁。你是内识的初学者，因此可以学习所有事物。</p><p>PRACTICE 34: Two 15-minute practice periods.</p><p>练习34：两个15分钟的练习时段</p>]]></content>

It involves the reclamation of Knowledge and the proper engagement with others to bring about specific results in the world. It is not so important at this moment that you evaluate your current life to see if it reflects this greater purpose, for you are now involved in the reclamation of Knowledge. As your Knowledge becomes stronger, it will shine its beneficence upon you and through you. Your activities will then be adjusted as is necessary. Thus, you need not blame or condone the past or your current activities, for you are now adhering to a greater strength within you.</p><p>你的生活中有一个需要完成的使命，这是你来到这里之前就给予你的使命，也是你离开后将会回顾的使命。它涉及到内识的回收以及与他人的适当互动，以在世界上带来特定的结果。此时此刻，重要的不是评估你当前的生活是否反映了这个更大的目的，因为你现在正在参与内识的重新开垦。随着你的内识变得更加强大，它将在你身上并通过你照耀它的益处。然后你的活动将根据需要进行调整。因此，你不需要责备或宽恕过去或你目前的活动，因为你现在正坚持依靠你内在的更大力量。</p><p>IN YOUR TWO LONG PRACTICE PERIODS TODAY, dwell upon the idea that there is a great mission that you have in life. Think about this. Do not become immediately convinced by your own first responses. Think about it carefully. Think what this could mean. Think of the moments in your life when you have thought of this before or have entertained its possibility. In your two practice periods, you will have an opportunity then to consider this, but beware—make no conclusions yet.</p><p>在今天的两个长时间练习时段中，思考你在生活中拥有一个伟大使命的想法。仔细思考这一点。不要立即被你的第一反应所说服。仔细思考它可能意味着什么。回想你生活中曾经思考过这个问题或曾经考虑过这种可能性的时刻。在你的两个练习时段中，你将有机会考虑这个问题，但要注意——暂时不要做出结论。</p><p>PRACTICE 33: Two 30-minute practice periods.</p><p>练习33：两个30分钟的练习时段</p>]]></content>

Use your breath to take you deeper, for your breathing will always take you beyond your thoughts if you adhere yourself to it conscientiously. Let nothing distract or dissuade you. If something permeates your mind and you have difficulty releasing it, tell yourself that you will look at it a little later, but that right now you are taking a small vacation from your mind. Practice feeling the truth. Do not think the truth. Practice feeling the truth.</p><p>在你的两个较长的练习时段中，每次持续30分钟，静静地坐着，闭上眼睛，深呼吸并保持规律，尝试感受你心灵不断动荡之外的真理。使用你的呼吸带你更深入，因为如果你认真地坚持使用呼吸，它总是能带你超越你的思维。不要让任何想法分散你的注意力或劝阻你。如果有什么事情充斥你的思绪并且你难以释放，告诉自己你稍后会看它，但现在你正在从你的思绪中短暂休假。练习感受真理。不要思考真理。练习感受真理。</p><p>PRACTICE 32: Two 30-minute practice periods.</p><p>练习32：两个30分钟的练习时段</p>]]></content>

As this is affirmed, it becomes more apparent to you, and you are able to experience it more and more in time.</p><p>这代表了你对内识的渴望。它代表了你对和平的渴望。这些渴望本质上是相同的。这种渴望源自你内心的内识。它可能与其他欲望相竞争，可能威胁到其他关系，尽管并非必然如此。因此，今天的肯定反映了你生命中的真实意愿。当这被肯定时，它会变得更加明显，随着时间的推移，你将能够越来越多地体验到它。</p><p>TODAY UPON EACH HOUR, FEEL YOUR DESIRE to see a different world.

To develop this quality of self-observation, you must be as free of judgment as possible, for judgment disables you from being observant. You must study yourself as if you were someone else with whom you can be far more objective.</p><p>在这个特殊的练习日，全天观察自己，尽可能地保持对自己思想和行为的觉察。为了发展这种自我观察的品质，你必须尽可能地不做判断，因为判断使你无法观察。你必须研究你自己，就好像你是别人，这样你才能更客观地看待自己。</p><p>WE SHALL PRACTICE ON THE HOUR TODAY. Each hour you will need to check in to see your thoughts and to observe your current behavior. This constant self-checking will enable you to become far more involved in your current experience and will allow your Knowledge to exercise its beneficial influence upon you to a far greater degree. Knowledge knows what you need and knows how to serve you, but you must learn how to receive. In time, you must learn how to give as well so that you may receive more. Your receiving is important because it enables you to give, and giving is the essence of fulfillment in this world. But you cannot give from an impoverished state. Therefore, your giving must be genuine, born of the overflowing receptivity that you have cultivated within yourself, within your relationships with others and with life.</p><p>我们将在今天每小时进行练习。每个小时你都需要检查自己的思想并观察自己当前的行为。这种持续的自我检查将使你能够更深入地参与到当前的经历中，并将允许你的内识更大程度地发挥其有益的影响。内识知道你需要什么并知道如何为你服务，但你必须学会如何接受。随着时间的推移，你也必须学会如何给予，以便你能接受更多。你的接受很重要，因为它使你能够给予，而给予是在这个世界上实现自我满足的本质。但是，你不能从一个贫瘠的状态给予。因此，你的给予必须是真诚的，源于你内心溢出的接受能力，在你与他人和生命的关系中培养出来。</p><p>EACH PRACTICE PERIOD NEED ONLY TAKE SEVERAL MINUTES but should be given your full attention. You need not close your eyes to do this, though if it is appropriate, it will be helpful. You may practice in the middle of a conversation with another. In fact, there are very few circumstances that will prevent this moment of introspection. In practice you simply ask yourself, “How do I feel?” and “What am I doing now?” That is all. Then feel if there is something you must do that you are not doing. If there are no corrections to be made, continue on with what you are doing. If there are corrections to be made, make them as expediently as possible. Allow your inner guidance to influence you, which it will do if you are not governed by impulses, fear or ambition. Observe yourself this day.</p><p>每个实践时段只需要几分钟，但应该给予你的全部注意力。你不需要闭上眼睛来做这个，虽然如果合适的话，这将是有帮助的。你可以在与他人交谈的过程中进行实践。实际上，很少有情况会阻止这一时刻的内省。在实践中，你只需问自己：“我感觉怎么样？”和“我现在在做什么？”就是这样。然后感觉是否有你必须做而没有做的事情。如果没有需要纠正的地方，请继续你正在做的事情。如果有需要纠正的地方，请尽快进行纠正。让你的内在指导影响你，如果你不受冲动、恐惧或野心的支配，它将这样做。今天观察自身。</p><p>PRACTICE 29: Hourly practice.</p><p>练习29：每小时练习</p>]]></content>

I accept my Teachers as my elder brothers and sisters. I accept my world as a place where Knowledge can be reclaimed and contributed. I accept my past as a demonstration of life without Knowledge. I accept the miracles of my life as a demonstration of the presence of Knowledge, and I give myself now to cultivate that which is of the greatest good within myself to be given to the world.”</p><p>“我接受我的内识作为上帝的礼物。我接受我的老师们作为我的兄长姐妹。我接受我的世界作为一个可以重新获得和贡献内识的地方。我接受我的过去作为一个没有内识的生命展示。我接受我生命中的奇迹作为内识存在的展示，并且我现在将培养我内在的至善，以便将其贡献给世界。”</p><p>ONCE AGAIN WE SHALL REVIEW THE PAST WEEK OF PRACTICE, rereading all of the instructions and with each step reviewing what has transpired in your times of practice. Be sure to ask yourself how deeply you were involved in practice—how much you wanted to search and investigate, how carefully you examined your own experience and to what extent you felt motivated to penetrate whatever barriers that might exist.</p><p>我们将再次回顾过去一周的练习，重新阅读所有的指导，并且在每一个步骤中回顾在你的练习时间里发生了什么。务必问自己你在练习中的参与程度有多深——你有多么想要探索和调查，你多仔细地检查了自己的经历，以及你在多大程度上感觉有动力去突破可能存在的障碍。</p><p>OUR ONE 45-MINUTE PRACTICE PERIOD OF REVIEW WILL begin to give you a perspective on your development in this preparation. This is beneficial not only for yourself but for those whom you will serve in the future, for as you are receiving now, you will wish to give in whatever context and in whatever form is appropriate for you. You must understand how people learn and how people develop. This must come from your own experience and must represent the love and compassion that are the natural emanations of your Knowledge. Again do not let any doubt or confusion dissuade you from your true application.</p><p>我们的一次45分钟的练习回顾期将开始给你一个关于你在这个准备中的发展的视角。这不仅对你自己有益，也对那些将来你将服务的人有益，因为你现在正如你希望在任何情境和任何形式中给予的那样接受。你必须理解人们如何学习和如何发展。这必须来自你自己的经验，并且必须代表你的内识自然散发的爱与慈悲。再次，不要让任何疑惑或混乱劝阻你真实的应用。</p><p>PRACTICE 28: One 45-minute practice period.</p><p>练习28：一个45分钟的练习时段</p>]]></content>

If you are not feeling this, it means that you are entertaining something that is false and without true foundation in your being. If you have ever felt that the truth betrayed you, then you have not recognized its value. Perhaps it disappointed your plans and goals. Perhaps you lost something you really wanted. Perhaps it prevented you from seeking something that was desirable. But in all cases it has saved you from pain and misery. Until your true function has been recognized, you cannot appreciate how the truth has served you, for until your function is discovered, you will attempt to claim and justify other functions. If these other functions are discouraged or denied by the truth, there can be great confusion and conflict. Yet remember that the truth has always saved you from a greater error that you would have committed otherwise.</p><p>这个肯定表达了你的真实意愿。如果你没有这种感觉，那说明你正在容纳一些虚假的、在你的存在中没有真实基础的关系。如果你曾经觉得真理背叛了你，那是因为你没有认识到它的价值。也许它让你的计划和目标受挫，也许你失去了某个你真正想要的关系，也许它阻止了你追求某个渴望的事物。但在所有情况下，它都救你脱离了痛苦和悲惨。在你的真实职能被认识到之前，你无法体会到真理对你的帮助，因为在你发现自己的职能之前，你会试图追求并证明其他职能的合理性。如果这些其他职能被真理否决或打压，会引发极大的困惑和冲突。然而，请记住，真理总是会拯救你免于犯下更大的错误。</p><p>PEOPLE CANNOT EXPERIENCE KNOWLEDGE because they are preoccupied with thoughts and judgments. These thoughts and judgments create a self-enclosed world for an individual, a selfenclosed world where they cannot see out. They can only see the content of their thoughts and this colors their experience of life entirely, so much so that they cannot see life at all.</p><p>人们无法体验到内识，因为他们专注于思维和判断。这些思维和判断为个人创造了一个自我封闭的世界，在这个自我封闭的世界中，他们无法看到外面的世界。他们只能看到自己的思维内容，而这些内容完全影响了他们对生命的体验，以至于他们根本看不到生命。</p><p>THEREFORE, IN YOUR TWO 30-MINUTE PRACTICE PERIODS, look and see how the truth has served you. Look at experiences that were happy. Look at experiences that were painful. Particularly in painful experiences, look at how the truth has served you. Look openly. Do not defend a former position if you are tempted to do so. If pain still exists from a loss of an earlier time, accept that pain and its discouragement, but try to look and see how you were truly served by that loss.</p><p>因此，在两次30分钟的练习中，看看真理是如何帮助你的。看看那些快乐的经历，也看看那些痛苦的经历。尤其是在痛苦的经历中，看看真理是如何帮助你的。开放地看，不要去捍卫过去的立场，即使你被诱惑去这样做。如果过去的损失仍然让你痛苦，接受那种痛苦和失望，但尝试去看看那次损失是如何真实帮助你的。</p><p>THIS POINT OF VIEW OF BEING SERVED by your experience is something you must cultivate. It does not justify the experience itself. Understand this. It merely gives you an opportunity to use your experience for your advancement and your empowerment. Truth operates in the world of illusions to help those who are responding to truth in their lives. You are responding to truth or you would not be undertaking this program of development. Thus, you have arrived at the juncture where it seems that the truth competes with other things and is, therefore, very hard to recognize. In this program of development, the truth will be distinguished from everything else in such a way that you can experience it directly and will not be confused about its appearance or its beneficial existence in your life. For the truth is here to serve you as you are here to serve the truth.</p><p>这种从经验中获得服务的观点需要你培养。请理解，它并不为经验本身辩护。它只是给你一个机会来利用你的经验来提升自己并增强自己的力量。真理在虚幻的世界中运作，以帮助那些在生活中回应真理的人。你正在回应真理，否则你不会开始这个发展计划。因此，你已经到达一个似乎真理与其他事物竞争的节点，因此很难辨认。通过这个发展计划，真理会与其他一切区分开来，以便你能直接体验到它，并不会对它的出现或它对你生活的有益存在感到困惑。因为真理在此是为了帮助你，就像你在此是为了帮助真理。</p><p>PRACTICE 27: Two 30-minute practice periods.</p><p>练习27：两个30分钟的练习时段</p>]]></content>

This is its only possible value. We do not condone error, but if error occurs, We wish to make it serve your truest need so that you may learn from it and repeat it no more. It is not merely for you to forget your errors, for you cannot do that. It is not merely for you to justify your errors, for this will make you dishonest. It is not merely for you to look upon your errors as pure service to you, for they have indeed been painful. What this truly means is that you recognize that error is error and then you attempt to use it on your own behalf. The pain of error and the tribulation of error must be accepted, for this will teach you what is real and what is not, what to value and what not to value. Using your error for development means you have accepted the error, and now you are attempting to utilize it to derive value from it because until value is derived from error, it is error only and will be a source of pain and discomfort for you.</p><p>试图为错误辩护是没有意义的，但错误可以引导你去珍视真理，从而导致真实的内识。这是它唯一可能的价值所在。我们不赞同错误，但如果错误发生了，我们希望让它为你真实的需求服务，以便你能从中学到，并不再重复。你不仅仅是为了忘记你的错误，因为你无法做到。你不仅仅是为了为你的错误辩护，因为这会让你变得不诚实。你不仅仅是为了将你的错误视为纯粹为了服务于你，因为它们确实是痛苦的。这真正意味着你认识到错误就是错误，然后你试图为自己利用它。错误的痛苦和错误的磨难必须被接受，因为这将教会你什么是真实的，什么不是，什么值得珍视，什么不值得珍视。将你的错误用于发展意味着你已经接受了错误，现在你正在尝试利用它来获得价值，因为直到从错误中获得价值，它只是错误，将为你带来痛苦和不适。</p><p>TODAY, IN YOUR TWO 30-MINUTE PRACTICE PERIODS, look at specific errors that you have made that have been very painful. Do not try to dismiss the pain of them, but see how in your current circumstances in life you can use them for your own benefit. Using errors in this way can show you what you need to do and what corrections or adjustments need to be made to enhance the quality of your life. Remember that any resolution to error always engenders true recognition and true discernment in relationship.</p><p>今天，在两次30分钟的练习中，回顾你所犯过的具体错误，这些错误曾让你非常痛苦。不要试图忽略它们带来的痛苦，而是看看在你当前的生命中，你如何利用这些错误来获得自己的利益。通过这种方式利用错误，可以展示你需要做什么，以及为提高生活质量需要进行哪些纠正或调整。记住，对错误的任何解决方案都会在关系中带来真实的认知和真实的辨别力。</p><p>IN YOUR PRACTICE PERIODS REVIEW THE ERRORS that come to mind as you sit quietly alone, and then see how each one can be utilized to your current benefit. What needs to be learned from them? What must be done that was not done before? What must not be done that was done before? How can these errors be recognized in advance? What were the signs that preceded them and how can such signs be recognized in advance of error in the future?</p><p>在练习中，回顾你独自静坐时浮现出来的错误，然后看看每一个错误如何能对你当前的情况有所帮助。从中需要学到什么？以前没有做过的事，现在需要做什么？以前做过的事，现在不该做什么？如何提前识别这些错误？它们之前有哪些迹象，如何在未来的错误发生前识别这些迹象？</p><p>USE THESE PRACTICE PERIODS for this introspective process and when you are done, do not speak of the results to any other person, but allow the investigation to continue naturally, as it naturally will.</p><p>将这些练习用于自省，当你完成后，不要与任何人讨论结果，让这种探索自然地继续下去，因为它会自然而然地继续。</p><p>PRACTICE 26: Two 30-minute practice periods.</p><p>练习26：两个30分钟的练习时段</p>]]></content>

It is something that must be experienced, for no great truth can be contained in an idea alone, though ideas may reflect it within your current experience. Great truth is a product of great relationship. You hold a great relationship with life. You hold a great relationship with your true Teachers who are within you. Eventually you will experience great relationship with those in your outer life, but first you must experience the source of your great relationship in its true establishment already. Then it is a matter of merely transferring it to the world outside, which you will do naturally in time.</p><p>生命最伟大的真理是什么？它是必须要经历的，因为任何伟大的真理都不能仅仅存在于一个想法中，尽管想法可能在你当前的经验中反映出它。伟大的真理是伟大关系的产物。你与生命有着伟大的关系。你与存在于你内心的真实老师们有着伟大的关系。最终，你将会与你外在生活中的人建立起伟大的关系，但首先你必须已经经历了你伟大关系的源头的真实建立。然后，只需将其自然地转移到外部世界，这在时间上你会自然而然地做到。</p><p>IN YOUR TWO PRACTICE PERIODS, practice feeling this relationship. Again you are asked to receive because you must receive this to give it. Once it is received, it will give of itself naturally. In the process of this your worth is re-established because it is quite apparent. You do not need to misrepresent yourself or your experience. To share a great love honestly means you must be experiencing it. It is this experience that We wish to give you today.</p><p>在你的两个练习时段中，练习感受这种关系。再次，你被要求去接受，因为你必须先接受它才能给予它。一旦它被接受，它将自然地给予自己。在这个过程中，你的价值被重新建立，因为它是相当明显的。你不需要歪曲自己或你的经验。诚实地分享伟大的爱意味着你必须正在经历它。我们今天希望给你的就是这种经验。</p><p>PRACTICE 25: Two 15-minute practice periods.</p><p>练习25：二个15分钟的练习时段</p>]]></content>

In fact, you really are God’s love. Without pretense of any kind, at  the very core of yourself, this is your True Self. It is not the Self you yet experience, and until you do experience it, do not pretend that this is your experience. But hold in true awareness that this is your Self. You are a person, but you are greater than a person. How can you be unworthy of God’s love if that is what you are? Your Teachers surround you and provide that which you are so that you may experience yourself and your true relationship with life.</p><p>你确实是值得上帝的爱的。事实上，你确实就是上帝的爱。毫无假装，就在你的核心深处，这就是你的真实自我。这不是你目前经历的自我，直到你真正经历它之前，不要假装这就是你的经历。但要真正意识到这就是你的自我。你是一个人，但你比一个人更伟大。如果你就是这样，你怎么会不值得上帝的爱呢？你的老师们围绕着你，提供你所需要的，这样你就可以体验自己和你与生命的真实关系。</p><p>IN YOUR TWO PRACTICE PERIODS TODAY, practice receiving once again the love, support and direction of your Teachers, and if any thought obstructs this, if any feeling prevents this, remind yourself of your great worthiness. You are worthy not for what you have done in the world. You are worthy for who you are, where you have come from and where you are going. Your life may be filled with errors and mistakes, wrong decisions and poor choices, but you have still come from your Ancient Home to which you will return. Your worthiness in the sight of God is unchanged. There is only great effort to repair your errors so that you may experience your True Self so that it may be rendered into the world.</p><p>在今天的两次练习中，再次练习接受老师们的爱、支持和指引，如果有任何想法阻碍了这一点，如果有任何感觉妨碍了这一点，请提醒自己你的伟大价值。你的价值不在于你在这个世界上做了什么。你的价值在于你是谁，你从哪里来，要到哪里去。你的人生可能充满了错误和过失，错误的决定和糟糕的选择，但你仍然来自你的古老家园，你将回到那里。你在上帝眼中的价值不会改变。只有付出巨大的努力来弥补错误，你才能体验到真我，从而将真我呈现给世界。</p><p>THEREFORE, IN YOUR PRACTICE PERIODS, practice receptivity and experiencing true worthiness. Let no thought conflict with the greatest truth of life.</p><p>因此，在你的练习阶段，要练习接受和经历真实的价值。不要让任何想法与生命中最伟大的真理相冲突。</p><p>PRACTICE 24: Two 15-minute practice periods.</p><p>练习24：二个15分钟的练习时段</p>]]></content>

This idea may challenge existing ideas or beliefs, but it is true nonetheless. God’s Plan is invisible and recognized by very few because very few have the openness of mind and the quality of attention that will allow them to see what is obviously occurring around them, which at this point is not obvious to them at all. Your Teachers love you, surround you and support you, for you are emerging into Knowledge. This calls them to your side. You are one of the few who has the promise and the opportunity to emerge from the sleep of your own imagination into the grace of Reality.</p><p>这个真理将会在你准备好的时候显而易见，但现在可能需要极大的信念。这个想法可能会挑战现有的观念或信仰，但它仍然是真实的。上帝的计划是无形的，只有极少数人能够认识到，因为很少有人同时拥有开放的心智状态与高度集中的注意力，使他们能够看到周围显而易见的存在，而这在此时对他们来说根本不明显。你的老师们爱你，围绕着你，支持着你，因为你正在进入你的内识。这召唤他们来到你身边。你是少数几个有希望、有机会从自己想象的沉睡中走出，进入现实世界的人之一。</p><p>THEREFORE, IN YOUR TWO PRACTICE PERIODS TODAY, feel this love, support and direction. It is a feeling. It is not ideas. It is a feeling. It is something you must feel. Love is something you must feel to know. You are indeed loved, surrounded and supported by your Teachers, and you are very worthy of their great gift to you.</p><p>因此，在今天的两次练习中，感受这份爱、支持和指引。它是一种持续的感觉。它不是想法。它是一种感觉。这是你必须感受到的。爱是你必须感受到才能知道的礼物。你确实被老师们爱着、围绕着、支持着，你非常值得他们给你的伟大礼物。</p><p>Practice 23: Two 15-minute practice periods.</p><p>练习23：二个15分钟的练习时段</p>]]></content>

Though given in many different forms, in different eras, in different worlds, a very similar kind of training was given to them that was geared wisely to their former state of mind and circumstances in life.</p><p>你确实被上帝的老师们所围绕，他们在很多方面都接受过与你现在类似的训练。尽管他们在不同的时代、不同的世界接受了不同形式的训练，但他们所接受的训练是非常相似的，都是根据他们以前的心智状态和生活环境而进行的明智训练。</p><p>TODAY, IN TWO 15-MINUTE PRACTICE PERIODS, feel the presence of the Teachers of God. You cannot yet see them with your eyes, and you cannot yet hear them with your ears because these faculties of sense have not been refined sufficiently yet, but you can feel their presence, for their presence surrounds and protects you. In your practice, let not other thoughts interfere. Do not give in to doubt or confusion, for you must prepare to have the reward that you seek, and you must know that you are not alone in the world to have the strength, the confidence and the resource of wisdom necessary to achieve that which you were sent here to achieve.</p><p>今天，在两个15分钟的练习时间里，感受上帝之师的存在。你还不能用眼睛看到他们，也不能用耳朵听到他们的声音，因为这些感官能力还不够完善，但你可以感受到他们的存在，因为他们的存在围绕着你，保护着你。在你的练习中，不要让其他想法干扰你。不要屈服于怀疑或困惑，因为你必须为获得你所追求的奖赏做好准备，你必须知道，在这个世界上，你并不孤单，你有力量、有信心、有必要的智慧资源来实现你被派到这里来实现的目标。</p><p>YOU ARE SURROUNDED BY THE TEACHERS OF GOD. They are here to love, support and direct you.</p><p>你被上帝的老师们所围绕。他们在这里爱着你，支持着你，指导着你。</p><p>PRACTICE 22: Two 15-minute practice periods.</p><p>练习22：二个15分钟的练习时段</p>]]></content>

Practice today not making any conclusions, but simply recognize the line of development and take note of the progress that you have made thus far. It is too early to make genuine conclusions, though it may be very tempting to do so. Beginning students are not in a position to judge their curriculum. This right must be earned and comes later if you wish for your judgments to have true effect and to be wise.</p><p>在第三次回顾中，回顾过去一周的所有课程以及这些课程的结果。今天的练习不要做任何结论，只需认识到发展的方向，并注意到迄今为止你所取得的进步。现在下真正的结论还为时过早，尽管这样做很有诱惑力。初学者无法对他们的课程作出评价。如果你希望你的判断具有这个真实的效果且明智，那么这种权利必须在以后获得。</p><p>THEREFORE, IN YOUR ONE PRACTICE PERIOD, review the last section of practice and all that has been experienced thus far.</p><p>因此，在这次练习中，回顾上一节练习和迄今为止所经历的一切。</p><p>PRACTICE 21: One 45-minute practice period.</p><p>练习 21 ：一个 45 分钟的练习时段</p>]]></content>

You have a greater goal which is being illustrated in this program of preparation. Do not let doubt and confusion be an obstruction to you. To be a true student means that you are assuming very little and that you are directing yourself in a manner that you do not prescribe for yourself but which is given to you from a Greater Power. The Greater Power wishes to raise you to its own level of ability. In this way, you receive the gift of preparation so that you may give it to others. In this way, you are given that which you cannot provide for yourself. You realize your individual power and ability because they must be developed in order for you to follow a program of this nature. You also realize your inclusion in life as life strives to serve you in your true development.</p><p>除了你自己的犹豫不决，还有什么能减缓你的进展？而犹豫不决的根源何在？无非是产生心灵混乱的因素。你有一个更伟大的目标，这个目标在你所做的准备过程中得到了展示。不要让怀疑和混乱成为你的障碍。成为一名真实的学生，意味着你的假设很少，并且你以一种并非自定的方式引导你自己，而是从更伟大的力量那里得到引导。这种更伟大的力量希望提升你的能力到它自己的层面。通过这种方式，你接收了准备的礼物，这样你就能够将它给予他人。通过这种方式，你会得到你自己无法提供的礼物。你意识到你的个人力量和能力，因为它们必须被发展起来才能让你遵循这样的计划。你也会意识到你在生命中的位置，因为生命在努力为你的真实发展服务。</p><p>THEREFORE, PRACTICE THE SAME PRACTICE that you attempted in the previous day in your two practice periods, and do not let doubt or confusion dissuade you. Be a true student today. Allow yourself to concentrate on your practice. Give yourself to practice. Be a true student today.</p><p>因此，在今天的两次练习中，继续进行前一天的练习，不要让疑虑或困惑阻碍你。今天做一名真实的学生。专注于练习，投入练习。今天做一名真实的学生。</p><p>PRACTICE 20: Two 15-minute practice periods.</p><p>练习20：两个15分钟的练习时段</p>]]></content>

It too requires a refinement of your mind’s faculties. To see with clear vision means you are not seeing with preference. It means that you are able to perceive that which is actually occurring rather than that which you wish to see. There is something actually occurring beyond your wishes. This is very true. The desire to see, then, is the desire to see a greater truth. This requires a greater honesty and a greater openness of mind.</p><p>看见的渴望就像知道的渴望一样。它也需要对你心灵自然能力的提升。清晰地看见意味着你不是用偏见去看，而是能够感知到实际发生的现实，而不是你希望看到的现实。实际上，除了你的愿望之外，确实有某些事情正在发生。这是非常真实的，因此，看见的渴望，实际上是渴望看见更伟大的真理。这需要更大的诚实和更开放的心灵。</p><p>TODAY IN YOUR TWO PRACTICE SESSIONS, practice looking upon one simple mundane object. Do not take your eyes off of that object, but look and practice looking very conscientiously. You are not trying to see anything. You are simply looking with an open mind. When the mind is open, it experiences its own depth, and it experiences the depth of what it is perceiving.</p><p>今天，在你的两个练习时段中，练习专注于一个简单的日常物体。不要把眼睛从那个物体上移开，而是仔细地看，练习非常专心地注视。你不是在试图看到什么特定的东西，而只是用开放的心灵去看。当心灵是开放时，它就能体验到它自己的深度，并体验到它所感知到的事物的深度。</p><p>CHOOSE ONE SIMPLE OBJECT THAT HAS VERY LITTLE MEANING for you and gaze upon it twice today for at least 15 minutes. Allow your mind to become very still. Breathe deeply and regularly as you gaze upon this object. Allow your mind to settle down into itself.</p><p>选择一个对你而言没有太大意义的简单物体，今天注视它两次，每次至少15分钟。让你的心灵变得非常静止。注视物体时深呼吸，保持规律的呼吸。让你的心灵逐渐平静下来。</p><p>PRACTICE 19: Two 15-minute practice periods.</p><p>练习 19 ：两个 15 分钟的练习时段</p>]]></content>

It is not merely an idea; it is not merely an image, though images and ideas may accompany it. It is an experience, and so it is something that is deeply felt. It may manifest in slightly different ways for those who are beginning to penetrate it, but nonetheless it will arise. It is something you must feel. To have a feeling orientation, your mind must be still. Truth is something you will feel with your entire body, with your entire being.</p><p>真理必须被完全体验。它不能仅仅是一个想法；它不能仅仅是一个图像，尽管图像和想法可能伴随着真理。它是一种体验，因此是深刻感受到的经历。对于那些开始触及真理的人来说，它可能以略有不同的方式显现，但无论如何真理都会升起。这是你必须感受到的体验。要有感觉的定向，你的心灵必须静止。真理是你将用你整个身体、你的整个存在来感受的体验。</p><p>KNOWLEDGE DOES NOT SPEAK TO YOU AT EVERY MOMENT, but it always holds a message for you. To come into the proximity of Knowledge means that you become more and more like Knowledge itself—more whole, more consistent, more honest, more devoted, more concentrated, more selfdisciplined, more compassionate and more self-loving. All of these qualities are developed as you approach that which is the source of these qualities.</p><p>内识并不是在每一个时刻都对你讲话，但它总是为你保留一条讯息。接近内识意味着你变得越来越像内识本身——更完整，更一致，更诚实，更投入，更集中，更自律，更有同情心，更自爱。所有这些品质都是在你接近这些品质的源头时发展起来的。</p><p>IT IS IN THIS DIRECTION THAT YOU WILL PRACTICE moving today as you feel the truth arising within yourself. This will join all aspects of you, giving you a uniform experience of yourself. In your three 15-minute practice periods, give your full attention to feeling the truth arising within yourself. Practice in stillness, and do not be discouraged if it is difficult at first. Simply practice and you will proceed.</p><p>今天，当你感受到真理在你内心深处萌发时，你将朝着这个方向前进。这将结合你的各个方面，给你一个统一的自我体验。在三个15分钟的练习时间里，全神贯注地感受你自己内心深处产生的真理。在静止练习中，如果一开始有困难，也不要气馁。只需练习，你就会继续前进。</p><p>THROUGHOUT THE DAY AS WELL, without doubt or hesitation, pursue your true goal in life. From this true goal will come all of the important things that you will need to accomplish and the great power of vision and discernment that will allow you to find those individuals that you have come into the world to find.</p><p>在这一天里，你也要毫不怀疑、毫不犹豫地追求你真实的生命目标。从这个真实的目标出发，你将完成所有需要完成的重要事情，你将拥有远见和辨别力的伟大力量，让你找到那些你来到这个世界上想要找到的人。</p><p>PRACTICE 18: Three 15-minute practice periods. </p><p>练习 18 ：三个 15 分钟的练习时段</p>]]></content>

Developing the ability to hear and the desire to hear will yield to you that which you seek. The truth is utterly beneficial to you, but at first it can be quite shocking and disappointing to your other plans and goals. This you must risk if you wish to have the certainty and the empowerment that the truth will bring to you. The truth always brings resolution of conflict, always provides an experience of self, always gives you a sense of current reality and always provides direction for you to move forward.</p><p>渴望听见真理既是一个过程，也是真实准备的结果。发展听见的能力和听见的欲望将使你获得你所寻求的内识。真理对你是完全有益的，但起初，它可能会让你的其他计划和目标感到震惊和失望。如果你希望拥有真理带来的确定性和赋权，你必须冒这个风险。真理总是带来冲突的解决，总是提供一种自我的体验，总是给你一种当前现实的感觉，总是为你指明前进的方向。</p><p>TODAY, IN YOUR THREE 15-MINUTE PRACTICE PERIODS, practice listening to the truth, trying to listen beyond the mind and emotions. Again do not be concerned if all you hear is the rushing about of your own thoughts. Remember, you are developing listening. That is the most important thing. Like exercising a muscle in the body, you are exercising the faculty of mind called listening. Therefore, this day practice listening, taking these practice periods to devote yourself so that you may feel the truth arising within you.</p><p>今天，在你三个15分钟的练习时段中，练习聆听真理，试图超越心灵和情感去聆听。再次提醒，如果你听到的只是你自己思想的喧嚣，请不要担心。记住，你在发展聆听的能力。这是最重要的。就像锻炼身体中的肌肉一样，你在锻炼称为聆听的心灵能力。因此，今天练习聆听，在这些练习时段中全身心投入，以便你能感受到真理正在你的内心深处升起。</p><p>PRACTICE 17: Three 15-minute practice periods.</p><p>练习 17 ：三个 15 分钟的练习时段</p>]]></content>

This true content wishes to express itself in the context of your current life and current situation. To discern this you must listen carefully and in time realize the difference between the true content of your mind and its messages for you and all the other impulses and wishes that you feel. To separate thoughts from Knowledge is one of the great accomplishments which you will have an opportunity to learn in this course.</p><p>“今天我会聆听我的体验，找出我心灵的内容。”要意识到，你心灵的真实内容就埋藏在你自出生以来所添加的一切内容之下。这个真实的内容希望在你当前的生命和现状中表达它自己。为了辨识这一点，你必须仔细聆听，并及时意识到你心灵的真实内容及其为你传递的讯息与你感受到的所有其他冲动和愿望之间的区别。将思想与内识区分开来，是你在本课程中将有机会学习到的伟大成就之一。</p><p>THE ONE PRACTICE TODAY OF 45 MINUTES will be devoted to inner listening. This will require that you listen without judgment of yourself, even if the content of your thoughts is disturbing. Even if the content of your thoughts is disagreeable, you must listen without judgment to allow your mind to open. You are listening for something deeper than the mind, but you must go through the mind to get there.</p><p>今天的一次练习，持续45分钟，将致力于内在的聆听。这将要求你在聆听时不对你自己进行评判，即使你的思想内容令人不安。即使你的思想内容令人反感，你也必须不带评判地倾听，允许你的心灵可以打开。你在倾听比心灵更深层次的内识，但你必须通过心灵才能到达那里。</p><p>Practice 15: One 45-minute practice period.</p><p>练习 15 ：一个 45 分钟的练习时段</p>]]></content>

We do not give it here as an affirmation but as an expression of your current state. You want to be separate because this defines your self; your self is defined in terms of separation, not in terms of inclusion. Separation is the source of all your pain and confusion of mind. Your physical life demonstrates a separate life but only from a certain point of view. Given another point of view, it does not demonstrate separation at all. It demonstrates a unique expression of a Greater Reality.</p><p>这个想法代表了分离的真实动机，但它是不必要的。在这里，我们并不把它作为一种肯定，而是作为你当前状态的一种表达。你想要分离，因为这定义了你的自我；你的自我是以分离的方式定义的，而不是以包容的方式定义的。分离是你所有痛苦和心灵混乱的根源。你的物质生命展示了一种分离的生命，但这只是从某个角度来看的。从另一个角度来看，它根本没有表现出分离。它展示的是更伟大现实的独特表达。</p><p>ON TWO OCCASIONS TODAY, spend 15 minutes concentrating upon the idea for today. Think seriously about what this lesson means and call upon your own experience to reflect upon its relevance to your life. Reflect upon what your desire for separation has cost you in time, energy and pain. Realize your motivation for separation and you will know that you want to be free.</p><p>今天有两次机会，花15分钟集中思考今天的想法。认真思考这节课的意义，并调用你自己的经验来反思它与你生命的相关性。反思你对分离的渴望让你付出了多少时间、能量和痛苦的代价。意识到你分离的动机，你就会知道你想要自由。</p><p>PRACTICE 13: Two 15-minute practice periods.</p><p>练习 13 ：两个 15 分钟的练习时段</p>]]></content>

This is so obvious if you look at yourself with simplicity and realize that the very makeup of your body, the very fabric of your physical life, is completely made of what life is in the physical. It is quite apparent that you are made of the same “stuff” as everything else around you. What is mysterious is your mind. It seems to be a distinct point of understanding, but it is as much a part of life as your physical fabric. You are an individual unaware of your Source and your total inclusion in life. Your individuality is a burden now, but it will be a great happiness to you when it can express life itself.</p><p>无论围绕你的个体性及所有与你个人相关的事物——你的身体、你的想法、你的困难、你独特的表达形式、你的特质、你的才能——建立了多么伟大的体系，你都不与生命分离。如果你简单地看待你自己，你就会意识到你身体的构造、你物质生命的基本结构，完全是由生命的物质构成的，这一点是显而易见的。这显然表明你和你周围的一切是由相同的“材料”构成的。神秘的是你的心灵。它似乎是一个独特的理解点，但它与你的物质结构一样是生命的一部分。你作为一个个体并没有察觉到你的源头以及你在生命中的整体归属。你的个体性现在是一种负担，但当它能够表达生命本身时，它将给你带来一种伟大的幸福。</p><p>PRACTICE 11: Read the lesson three times today.</p><p>练习 11 ：今天阅读这个课程三次</p>]]></content>

There is a greater gift awaiting you, but you must prepare yourself mentally, emotionally and physically. Without Knowledge, you are unaware of your purpose. You are unaware of your origin and your destiny, and you will pass through this life as if it were a troubled dream and no more.</p><p>很好的问题！你为什么要这样做呢？你为什么要提出这样的问题？你为什么要寻求更伟大的事情？你为什么要付出努力？这些问题都是不可避免的。我们预料到了它们。你为什么要这样做？你这样做是因为内识是必要的。如果你希望过上一种超越纯粹表面和不稳定生活的更伟大生命，你必须深入探索，不能仅仅依赖脆弱的假设和希望的期望来建立自信。有一份更伟大的礼物正在等待着你，但你必须在心理上、情感上和身体上做好准备。没有内识，你就不会察觉到你的目的。你就不会察觉到你的起源和天命，你会像在梦中一样度过这一生，而这只是一场困扰的梦而已。</p>]]></content>

Today’s exercise, then, carries forth from the previous steps where you begin to see the difference between what you think you know and real Knowledge itself and the relationship between what you think of as Knowledge and your own assumptions, beliefs and hopes for things.</p><p>今天在你的三个简短的练习时间里，你要全神贯注地审视你的假设，思考你真正认为你知道的事情，包括那些以前从未想过质疑的事情——你认为你知道的事情。因此，今天的练习延续了之前的步骤，在这里你开始看到你认为你知道的事情与真正内识本身之间的区别，以及你认为是内识的事情与你自己的假设、信念和对事物的希望之间的关系。</p><p>THEREFORE, IN EACH PRACTICE SESSION it is very essential for you to think about the things you think you know. When you realize they are based primarily upon your assumptions, you will realize how weak is your foundation in the world. Understanding this may be upsetting and disconcerting, but it is absolutely essential for you to give you the impetus and the desire to discover your true foundation in the world.</p><p>因此，在每个练习中，思考你认为自己知道的事情是非常重要的。当你意识到它们主要基于你的假设时，你会意识到你在世界上的基础是多么脆弱。理解这一点可能会令人不安和困惑，但对于你获得动力和渴望去发现你在世界上的真实基础是绝对必要的。</p><p>PRACTICE 4: Three 10-minute practice periods.</p><p>练习4：三个 10 分钟的练习时段</p>]]></content>

Distinguish this question from all such orientations to the very best of your ability and ask yourself, “What do I really know?” You must continuously examine whatever answers you give to this question to see if they represent your beliefs or assumptions or the beliefs or assumptions of other people or perhaps even of humanity at large.</p><p>今天问你自己，你真正知道什么，并将你所知道的与你所认为、希望、害怕、相信、珍视和重视的知道区分开来。尽你最大的努力将这个问题与所有这些取向区分开来，然后问你自己，“我真正知道什么？”你必须不断审视你对这个问题的任何回答，看看它们是否代表你的信念或假设，或者是其他人甚至是整个人类的信念或假设。</p><p>THREE TIMES TODAY, FOR 10 MINUTES EACH, ask this question and think very seriously about your response and about the meaning of this question, “What do I really know?”</p><p>今天三次，每次10分钟，问这个问题并认真思考你的回答以及这个问题的意义，“我真正知道什么？”</p><p>PRACTICE 3: Three 10-minute practice periods. </p><p>练习 3：三个 10 分钟的练习时段</p>]]></content>

WHERE AM I?"></a>STEP 2KNOWLEDGE IS WITH ME. WHERE AM I?</h2><p>KNOWLEDGE IS WITH YOU, COMPLETELY, but it resides in a part of your mind to which you have not yet gained access. Knowledge represents your True Self, your True Mind and your true relationships in the universe. It also possesses your greater calling in the world and a perfect utilization of your nature, all of your inherent abilities and skills, even your limitations—all to be given for good in the world.</p><p>内识完全与你同在，但它存在于你心灵中一个你尚未接触到的部分。内识代表了你的真实自我、你的真实心灵和你在宇宙中的真实关系。它还拥有你在世界上的更伟大的召唤和完美地善用你的自然，你所有的固有能力和技能，甚至你的局限——所有这些都将为世界带来益处。</p><p>KNOWLEDGE IS WITH YOU, BUT WHERE ARE YOU? Today think about where you are. If you are not with Knowledge, where are you? Therefore, three times today, 10 minutes each, think about where you are, not just physically or geographically, but where you are in terms of your awareness of yourself in the world. Think very, very carefully. Do not allow your mind to distract you from this orientation. It is essential now at the beginning of your preparation to ask these questions very seriously.</p><p>内识与你同在，但你在哪里？今天思考你在哪里。如果你不与内识同在，那你在哪里呢？因此，今天三次，每次10分钟，思考你所在的位置，不仅仅是物理上或地理上，而是在你对你自己在世界中的觉知方面你处于什么位置。非常仔细地思考。不要让你的心灵从这个方向上分散你的注意力。在你准备的开始阶段，认真提出这些问题是至关重要的。</p><p>PRACTICE 2: Three 10-minute practice periods.</p><p>练习2：三个10分钟的练习时段</p>]]></content>

You must start from where you are, not from where you want to be. You start here in the understanding that you are without Knowledge. That is not to say that Knowledge is not with you. It is simply to say that you are not with Knowledge. Knowledge is waiting for you to proceed. Knowledge is waiting to give itself to you. Therefore, you are beginning now to prepare to be in relationship with Knowledge, the greater aspect of mind that you have brought with you from your Ancient Home.</p><p>在任何发展的关口，都必须有一个起点。你必须从你所在的位置开始，而不是从你想要达到的位置开始。你从这里开始，理解到你目前没有内识。这并不是说内识不与你同在，而是说你并未与内识同在。内识在等待着你继续前进。内识正等待着将它自己交给你。因此，你现在开始准备与内识建立关系，内识是你从古老家园带来的心灵的更伟大的一面。</p><p>THREE TIMES TODAY SPEND 10 MINUTES thinking about what Knowledge is, not merely applying your own ideas, not merely applying your past understanding, but thinking about what Knowledge really is.</p><p>今天花三次时间，每次十分钟，去思考内识是什么，不仅仅是运用你自己的想法，不仅仅是运用你过去的理解，而是真正去思考内识真正是什么。</p><p>PRACTICE 1: Three 10-minute practice periods.</p><p>练习 1 ：三个 10 分钟的练习时段</p>]]></content>
